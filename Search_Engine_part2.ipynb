were Danzo of the Hidden Leaf the Third Hokage and his advisors Homura and Koharu Just those four The Third Hokage died and now there are only three aging folk Still those three will probably never reveal the abominable truth The truth about Itachi will fade into darkness forever And that is what Itachi wished However I know the truth about Itachi too As I said earlier Itachi died without realizing that However he wanted to make doubly sure It seems Itachi did not trust me So just in case I did know the truth he planned to silence me with the Amaterasu He probably anticipated I would show my Sharingan in order to speak to you What is this What is this guy saying Protect me Protect The truth Think back Think carefully and remember about Itachi Watch any video online with OpenSUBTITLES Free Browser extension osdblinkext About your kind brother Whats wrong This is it right The place where Father works This is the headquarters of the Hidden Leaf Police Force Ive always been curious Why is the Uchiha crest on the police force logo What You noticed that Who wouldnt Welllets see Simply put it seems our ancestors formed and organized this police force And so they used our family crest as the symbol of this organization From ages past our clan has been entrusted with the safety of the village The Uchiha crest reflects the pride of our clan While its numbers have dwindled even today nearly everyone in the clan serves on Squad One and is dedicated to preserving the peace and safety of the village After all only exceptional ninja are capable of preventing crimes that ninja commit Father is great after all Are you going to work here too I wonder about that You should No he He tried to kill me He tried to take my eyes Who would do such a thing Foolish little brother Mangekyo Sharingan Calm down Breathe slowly Dont touch me Even if you do hate me Thats what big brothers are for Sorry Sasuke Another time Fate Youre awake Sorry but I took the liberty of tying you up Since you werent gonna stay still and listen to me He Itachi was my enemy He killed our parents He killed everyone in the clan He was a Rogue Ninja A member of the Akatsuki He was despicable He was my target Its true that he annihilated the Uchiha clan that night And he deserted the Hidden Leaf Then And that is what he was ordered to do by the Hidden Leaf That is the beginning of the truth about Itachi It was his mission Yes That night Itachi killed his personal feelings and fulfilled his mission It seems youve calmed down a bit What are you talking about In order to talk about Itachi I must take you back to the early days when Hidden Leaf Village was founded Itachi sacrificed himself This is fate that has continued since ages past He was sacrificed for it Sacrifice Thats correct A huge problem rooted since the time Hidden Leaf Village was founded That is what determined Itachis life Its a long story but everything I tell you is the truth On what basis should I believe you Youre untrustworthy Theres nothing I can show you as proof And its up to you whether you believe me or not But you will hear me out until I finish Fine So talk It all started more than years ago The world was in turmoil It was the age of war Nations battled for power and to increase their territories During this age of war ninjas consisted of individual clans serving as armed units They were hired by various nations to participate in the fighting And among the many ninja clans two were feared as the strongest One was us the Uchiha clan And the other was known as the Forests Senju Clan We of the Uchiha clan possessed exceptional chakra and the Sharingan Excelling in all types of warfare we became known as a battle clan And I was born into the Uchiha clan possessing chakra that was especially powerful Perhaps the fact that Ive lived this long is proof of that Back in those days all I did was battle In an age defined by power I sought to become ever stronger and killed my friends and even my younger brother Why you As a result I came into possession of the perfect Mangekyo Sharingan and became the leader of the Uchiha And using that power I fought the Senju clan countless times It was inevitable that I face Hashirama the leader of the Senju clan Wood Style Hashirama Senju the future first Hokage The one who stood at the top of the ninja world And the one I respected most The Senju clan led by Hashirama who became the First Hokage was feared and respected by all the other clans If the Senju moved so did the Uchiha Our clan was probably the only clan able to compete with them If a nation hired the Senju the opposing nation would hire the Uchiha We were like rivals The more I went up against Hashirama the more my name became known as well To get close to the top to measure my abilities To heighten your reputation You took your younger brothers eyes just for that I did take them But I needed power in order to protect the Uchiha Protect Yes As the Uchiha name spread its enemies increased It was a necessary sacrifice to protect the clan during the fierce fighting with the Senju and the other clans It was not for my fame My younger brother was in total agreement and offered his eyes to me But one day the Senju clan offered a truce And the Uchiha accepted it Everyone in both clans had grown weary of the fighting that had dragged on for so long They had enough But I I was the only one who opposed it Where has all the hate gone For what purpose had my brother sacrificed himself The Uchiha and Senju are like oil and water I couldnt help fearing that in time the Uchiha clan would come to be oppressed by the Senju clan Howevereveryone in the Uchiha clan wanted a truce As their leader I had no choice but to go along with their wishes Shortly thereafter the ninja alliance signed a pact with the Land of Fire which had sought dominion over the territories The secure one nation one village system was formed and became the Land of Fire and the Village Hidden in the Leaves Other countries adopted the one nation one village system And subsequently the fires of war were extinguished Momentary peace But due to a certain incident the Hidden Leaf Village quickly descended into turmoil A certain incident A fightfor the First Hokages seat As you know the first to occupy that seat was Hashirama Senju The Land of Fire and the entire clan chose Hashirama It was inevitable that the Uchihas hold on the reins of power would loosen I decided that the Uchiha should take leadership That we should confront Hashirama But no one not even from the Uchiha clan supported me My subordinates who did not wish to light the fires of war were unsympathetic and betrayed me I was accused of acting out of greed and selfinterest Not only that They scorned me as a selfish brother who stole his younger brothers eyes in order to save his own What brother would willfully hurt his younger brother I justI just wanted to protect the Uchiha I left the village Everyone betrayed me I became an avenger and declared war on the Hidden Leaf Village And I lost At that place which became known as the Final Valley I was saidto have died there Even Hashirama believed it And everyone forgot about me History forgot about me Hashiramas younger brother who became the Second Hokage was determined that there would never be a traitor like me again So as proof of his trust he granted the Uchiha a special position And he created the Hidden Leaf Police Force But the truth is This was to further distance the Uchiha from the reins of government Furthermore it was a way to keep a close eye on the entire clan There were Uchiha members who realized this Members who wanted to carry on my rebellion Butit was too late Time passed The Senju clan solidified its hold on power and the Uchiha fell to becoming Senju dogs And what I predicted came to pass A certain other incident sealed Uchihas figurative demise Yes The attack of the NineTailed Fox Demon years ago What do you mean The NineTails can only be tamed and controlled by the ocular powers of the Uchiha The higherups of Hidden Leaf Village perceived the Uchiha to be behind this attack That was a natural occurrence a natural calamity The Uchiha had nothing to do with it Yet suspicion fell on them That the Uchiha had revolted and sought to take power As a result the Uchiha was put under the strict surveillance of the Anbu Black Ops and they were forced to relocate to the outskirts of the village They became totally estranged The Third Hokage was the only one to voice opposition to our treatment But Danzo of the Anbu Black Ops and the rest of the councilors would not listen In the end the Uchiha clan was not trusted And the discrimination began Their distrust bred hatred and eventually their suspicions became reality The Uchiha clan plotted a coup d\\u00c3tat to take over the village The higherups in Hidden Leaf Village planted a spy within the Uchiha clan That spy was your older brother Itachi Uchiha From that moment Itachis suffering began You laid false charges against the Uchiha Thats Itachis lie I wont believe it Itachi tried to kill me If he really wanted to you certainly would be dead However Stop it Ive had enough You should know why Because you are Next time on Naruto Shippuden Truth That is Itachis truth Tune in again Support us and become VIP member to remove all ads from wwwOpenSubtitlesorg\",\n          \"THE NAMES OF PEOPLE INCIDENTS AND BACKGROUNDS OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL The doctor changed I remember clearly I saw it and heard it myself The doctor The doctor changed during the surgery I think we need the head surgeon here I told you The VIP is here so he cant come This is too dangerous The tumor is in an odd location so if we cut it here we might hurt her nerves Director Gu Hyunseong left her with us So you wont do a thing Will you take responsibility Assistant Director is the patient awake That was shocking Her tape came off I was frightened I hoped it was just a nightmare Does Banseok University Medical Center know that she remembers the ghost surgery No They wont even hear us out We went a few times to complain but they wouldnt even let us in Thats why we came to see you What a relief Sorry We can win this case Soyeon from today until your trial you wont remember that the doctor changed during the surgery No I saw and heard everything Plaintiff The surgeon in charge wasnt there and a different surgeon did my surgery Plaintiff Calm down If you cause any more disturbance you will be removed Watch any video online with OpenSUBTITLES Free Browser extension osdblinkext Then it mustve been a ghost A ghost What kind of nonsense The victim saw it but no other surgeon did the surgery Then the only answer is that it was a ghost An operation room ghost that doctors at Banseok cant see This is false information Please stop speaking Sustained Counsel for the plaintiff Please stop and take a seat I will prove to everyone here that the operation room ghost does exist What are you talking about Tell me Do you still not see him I see him clearly Let me introduce the Banseok University Medical Center ghost who did Ms Gils surgery Why are you here In this world proper doctors still outnumber those who arent Of course an attorney who only defends despicable ones wouldnt know YIHAN Yihan How did you find I came to have a talk with the junior I adore EPISODE This is Yes its a hospital Its not much yet but its cardiothoracic surgery Cardiothoracic surgery Even university hospitals have a hard time keeping one How can you do it here Thankfully I got all the medical equipment All I have to do now is find trustworthy staff someone like you Yosub You operated on Gil Soyeon didnt you How did you know that The victim remembers She remembers that Gu Hyunseong left during the surgery and another doctor came and performed ghost surgery The only one who can be a ghost surgeon for Gu Hyunseong is just you As you know Lee Dohyung and Cho Junghyun wont spill the truth We need your testimony to resolve the injustice Ms Gil faced And what if I cant be a doctor anymore I spent years I studied hard since middle school to get into a med school Then I did my internship residency and fellowship I held out for years without taking a moment off So if this mistake stops my career I know how you feel Just like you I was Gu Hyunseongs ghost It must feel unfair and frightening to have your license suspended and get kicked out of Banseok It might feel like a death sentence I felt the same way However this may be one mistake for us but to our patients that mistake lingers forever We operate on numerous patients but to them we are their only surgeon You told me that you hope I continue to be a cardiothoracic surgeon even if it isnt at Banseok I hope the same for you Even if it isnt at Banseok I hope you continue to remain as a doctor WITNESS Let me testify Im the ghost doctor who performed surgery on Ms Gil instead of the Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery Gu Hyunseong Are you admitting to your violation of the Medical Service Act Youre right I violated the Medical Service Act But I was threatened in the process Your Honor Stay quiet Threatened Who threatened you A man whos sitting here in the audience Assistant Director Lee Dohyung By the assistant director He was threatened What is going on Sorry What are you looking at Get to it But I cant operate on her without telling her guardians Then will they be happy if she leaves with her body part cut open It was either you or Director Gu Hyunseong anyway Were already short of staff so we have to make do with everything Just get started I couldnt turn it down I knew it was wrong but the surgery wasnt hard I thought I just had to perform it well But But the location of the tumor was unexpected This is too dangerous The tumor is in an odd location so if we cut it here we might hurt her nerves Director Gu Hyunseong left her with us So you wont do a thing Will you take responsibility Assistant Director is the patient awake That was shocking Her tape came off What do we do What if she heard us talk Shell think it mustve been a dream But still All right We have no choice now Youll have to do this successfully Then everything will be fine Im sorry I went into the OR before checking her CT scan I saw the danger once I checked the location of her tumor Yet I did not stop Im sorry Im so sorry Witness did you write yourself down as the surgeon in charge on the surgery record No I couldnt Why couldnt you The head of the Banseok Legal Team Attorney Pyo Eunsil over there gave me an order to stay silent on the change of surgeons This is slander The witness is slandering me with his onesided account According to Article Clause of the Medical Service Act when medical records are different from facts those who are affiliated must be imprisoned for up to three years Thats all for my questions Defense counsel do you wish to question him No The accounts of the witnesses completely disagree This means at least one side gave a false witness This may be a civil case but perjury is punished in the same way as a criminal case The witness accounts all align for the staff of the OR other than Choi Yosubs account So isnt it obvious to see which side committed perjury And the account of Choi Yosub the sole different one aligns perfectly with the victims statement In that case we have all the reasons to suspect which side is trying to cover up the truth DEFENDANT We must come to an agreement Well take a break for minutes DEFENDANT Man what will they do Both of you have done very well Do you think we can win Its a chance Banseok is also prepared well and above all the witness accounts completely disagree Im sorry No matter what happens I will gladly be punished If you tell me to quit being a doctor I will do that I mean it I am very sorry Why are you the only one whos apologizing The ones who did worse are making up lies and acting shamelessly Only you took my side today Why are you this sorry Why do you apologize Why are you bowing your head Im sorry Im Im so sorry Im sorry Im sorry Im so sorry Im sorry Man that idiot I told him to keep quiet but he just took himself down Why are cardiac surgeons always like this Our hospital is a mess You dont think well lose Do you Dont worry Its not like they have hard evidence The court wont accept ghost surgery What about awareness during anesthesia Are you saying theyll accept that I put her to sleep and witnessed that there wasnt a problem What now Do I get punished You just said it yourself In Korea awareness under anesthesia has never been considered medical malpractice No need to worry and keep your faces straight Lets walk in like winners not losers SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT I will announce the sentence In reflection on the account of Choi Yosub the witness its evident that the plaintiff remembers the conversation only those who were in the operating room could know Therefore the medical malpractice committed against the plaintiff such as awareness during anesthesia should be acknowledged However there isnt enough evidence to discern if the medical records were fabricated and if the surgeon was switched just as the plaintiff presented However the plaintiff suffered from medical malpractice during the mediastinal tumor resection and awareness during anesthesia The defendant must pay for restoring thyroid cartilage recovery and compensation for her mental distress Sentence The defendant must pay the plaintiff a total amount of million won Isnt this enough for us to say I won by decision Lady dont you know what winning by decision means You were destroyed by us Stop making excuses You can feel that way since our malpractice was acknowledged But thats not the case for him You probably worked hard to get your hands on the witness All such trouble for nothing Im not sure I dont think the match is over You dont think so What brings you here Prosecutor Geum I came to watch As you know I am greatly interested in Banseok And since I came around to watch I was thinking of indicting this case My dear junior you must be oblivious due to your lack of experience Even if hes found guilty of switching the surgeon he only gets fined up to three million won Its not even a fine Just a penalty Your hard work wont even put a scratch on Banseok I didnt say Ill indict him over switching the surgeon Hell be indicted for attempted murder What Attempted murder He opened up his patients body with a scalpel and left the OR Doesnt that mean he left her to die Then its attempted murder You psycho Do you think thatll work Why are you so worked up You can admit it and receive a favor just like Park Kitaes case Right I bet you cant do that this time Because this is Director Gu Hyunseong of Banseok Dont be so cheeky You barged in to arrest an innocent man with a false report only to get humiliated Dont be embarrassed again Dont worry Ill also indict him for violating the Medical Service Act and professional negligence resulting in injury Those are enough for imprisonment and revocation of his license Yes the trial is over Mr Han works like one of us He quietly turned a witness for their side and turned the tables at once I knew I chose the right man Also Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong was here Theyre leaving together Should I follow them No just come back They havent spent time alone in a long time You shouldnt interrupt them Youve watched Banseok R and D Centers activities and achievements up to now Now Ms Lim Yuna the new director of Banseok R and D Center who will be in charge going forward will give a speech Please give a round of applause Thank you for welcoming me Im the new director of Banseok R and D Center Lim Yuna First Id like to thank and express my respect for Chairman Gu Jingi for developing Banseok to be the best medical foundation in Korea over the past years Were living in a new

recruit outstanding talents and make the R and D Center an incubator to lead future medical technology through proactive exchanges with both domestic and global institutions Its quite good Can you go say hello Sure Hello I couldnt make a proper introduction earlier She is a CEO of a biopharmaceutical company Congratulations I was worried hearing that the new center director is so young What a passionate inauguration speech At BioValley in Boston startups founded by young CEOs are already recognized as unicorn companies worth trillions of wons If we dont want to fall behind them well need more young talent Yes of course Im very much looking forward to your accomplishments going forward Ill be rooting for you Thank you Thank you Sure Lets go that way Now the only thing thats really left is for us to become one family Well there is no reason to rush right It hasnt even been a month yet since she got back to Korea She is our precious daughter Hope you understand Yes of course I completely understand Hes my precious one and only son as well Hello Hello how are you Pardon me Chairman Gu Oh did everything finalize well Yes No actually I need to speak to you separately regarding that Attempted murder What do you mean attempted murder How did such nonsense come about Im sorry sir Ive never imagined Prosecutor Geum would side with a guy who killed her brother Thats why you shouldnt have let it go all the way to trial How could you allow one of our doctors to take the witness stand You said it wouldnt matter if the victim testified since she was delusional But nothing got taken care of properly Im sorry sir Ill correct the situation at all costs Ms Pyo Get out I cant stand the sight of you Get out Han Yihan Youre causing me trouble in the end This way NEWHOPE LAW OFFICE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF A LAWYER AN INTERVIEW WITH DIRECTOR GU JINGI OF BANSEOK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER INAUGURATION OF GU HYUNSEONG AND LEE DOHYUNG AT BANSEOKWON AGE MEDIASTINAL TUMOR RESECTION AWARENESS UNDER ANESTHESIA Youve been doing all of this alone I have people who are helping me SEOKJU VIPS HEART CHEON HYUNGU BAEK KANGHO PROSECUTORINCHARGE OF SEOKJUS CASE Kangho When I was held in custody for Seokjus trial Gu Jingi hired a convict to assault me and threatened to kill my mother unless I admit to breaching the Medical Service Act What If I hadnt admitted that way in court I doubt I wouldve come out of there alive Baek Kangho the prosecutor who charged me is working with Gu Jingi Its million won in cash We found it in your room Your medical license will be revoked for pocketing the bribe If you feel even the slightest remorse for Seokjus death admit the medical malpractice charge and ask for forgiveness Youre not even asking why my face is all beaten up Why are you doing this Youre not even listening to me Why are trying to blame me for Seokjus death Look Mr Han Yihan Do I look like a lawyer to you Im here to reveal your crime Other than the fact that youre a criminal it has nothing to do with me if you get hurt broken or killed Got that No way Kangho would never do that I know so If someone who would never do such a thing actually did so there must be another reason But why I dont understand it no matter how hard I think about it Why would Gu Jingi go out of his way to put a blame on you and kill Seokju to take away his heart Answer me You promised to be honest and tell me everything Why Why in the world did he do that Explain so that I can understand and believe it I said in court there is a ghost doctor at Banseok University Medical Center right Five years ago that was me What For many years I performed surgeries on numerous patients as a substitute In order for Gu Hyunseong to become the next director of the hospital he needed performance records of operating on VIP patients And as a part of the compensation I got to operate on Seokju at Banseokwon The night that I performed the heart transplant on Seokju a VIP with a concealed identity was rushed over to Banseokwon The patients heart was already removed so a transplant was needed immediately and Gu Jingi brought a heart Then that heart was Youre right I was deceived by Gu Jingi and transplanted Seokjus heart on the VIP patient How could he How could he do that as a human being Youre lying right How could a doctor I mean a human being A human being shouldnt do such a thing It just doesnt make sense I am sorry Had I known Had I stopped the surgery Seokju and my mom would still be by our sides I am sorry I am sorry Why are you looking at me like that You are wearing the earrings I promised to wear them for the inauguration And the other side The other one What do you mean The other earring Are you wearing it Of course Who wears one earring Then show me the other one Cant you do it Why are you being scary I am sorry I am so sorry I behaved strangely right Yes Very strangely But I will forgive you since today is a good day You should cool off I will change my hairstyle so that both earrings show Okay Thank you That punk How dare he toy with me Thank you Thank you Why didnt you tell me When you got out of the detention center five years ago you should have told me the truth You wouldnt have believed me then Besides I couldnt give an excuse Its true that Seokju died because of my wrong decision I dont ask for forgiveness I will also pay my dues once everything is done Welcome I am sorry that I wasnt at the inauguration I didnt want to make the situation messier How did Gu Hyunseong react You were right He asked to see the other one so I let him do that A prosecutor was here A prosecutor What do you mean Gu Hyunseong was here with a prosecutor I think he figured out that we were together How Dont worry If you do as I say nothing will happen Actually he will come to trust you more How did you prepare it Neither one of us knew that Hyunseong would show up How did you prepare the earrings I didnt prepare them Things simply worked out My goodness I thought hard about which presents would be meaningful to you the woman who has all I never imagined such a thing I bought the same earrings as the ones Gu Hyunseong gave you I didnt want to see you wearing a present from him when you were with me You always exceed my expectations and amaze me Dont take action no matter how he provokes you I understand Only the two of you can go in Okay Wait at the door Yes sir What are you doing Hold on We will be done soon Michael started the Queens Gambit Its daring and sharp Its the gambit that is best suited for the king However When the gamble fails you must pay the price How should we pay the price Restore Han Yihans medical license If you decline Honours Hand will sue The terms of the stock return we agreed upon will be called off as well Its a simple matter but I am curious about the reason Why do you ask for such a thing The reason Use your imagination until we meet again We cant do as he says Yihan shouldnt hold the scalpel again No need to make a fuss What he asked for was unexpected but its a cheap price to pay But Dont worry Han Yihan will never become a doctor again Why did you do that You could have asked for something bigger after a performance like this The piece that determines the game is the king But why is the queen stronger Because the king needs someone to fight for him Let me get this straight That lawyer guy will be your queen No Yuna is the queen My lovely partner who will support me by my side Han Yihan is my knight And a curveball you dont know where it will go Doesnt this look fun The man Chairman Gu Jingi feels the most threatened by will be my black knight Prosecutor Geum Nam Hyukchul is waiting in the interrogation room Oh right Yes Lets go Lawyer Han Yihan If you want to talk to me bring him to me Why do you want a lawyer all of a sudden You said you killed him because you didnt want to go down alone I thought I did But I changed my mind The murder case six years ago Ill file an appeal File an appeal But why do you want Han Yihan I may be locked up but I still have ears He won the trial against Banseok I can only trust competent lawyers like him What This isnt bad news to you either Once my appeal goes through you will get to hear all the dirty laundry Banseok is hiding I dont think I can do that Youre a deathrow convict who killed two doctors from Banseok Why would I bring in a lawyer who used to be a doctor at Banseok What if he becomes the third victim Who will take responsibility I wont kill him I want to put an end to this sickening prison life I have You can talk all you want but youre not getting him So tell me if theres any truth youve been holding back Or you can get a public defender What are you doing Youre crazy Get me Han

talk to him No Ill talk to him Jayden Lee He was the first Korean American to become the head of the Asian branch at Honours Hand five years ago When Banseok Foundation acquired a hospital in California and set up the R and D Center Honours Hand invested billion won Three hundred billion How do they have that much money The company manages enough funds that could run an entire country He invests aggressively His mergers and acquisitions are hostile He does whatever it takes to lobby his cause Hes known as a notorious lobbyist in the industry Its the biggest private equity firm in the world No way Yihan we should ask a lot for our fee How about million won No A billion won No I wont ask for money What Why not He promised to restore my medical license and provide us with medical equipment He will give us what I need the most Restore your license But how is that possible Gu Jingi of all people is stopping it Well see We also need to check how competent they are If he cant get that from Gu Jingi we dont need to work with him Gosh Lim Yuna Shes the only child of Im Taemoon the former ambassador to the US who will run for president next Shes gorgeous Her mother is Kim Sunhee

He said it had to be you He bit up his hand and created a scene by harming himself Well Im suspicious of his intention But I thought I should tell you at least Could this be a trap Even if its a trap I cant avoid it Dont worry I wont jump in recklessly Even a murderer must cherish his family BANSEOK UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE RESERVE OFFICERS TRAINING CORPS Is this a photoshoot Pardon Why are you trying to look pretty Its not a photoshoot Since its a dummy not a real patient you think you can just pretend to do it Ill deduct a point Wait And what kind of nurse would stop compression while performing CPR Ill deduct three points Wait Professor I can keep going Whats the point The patient already has a cardiac arrest To recover your points you should have used a defibrillator instead of continuing with CPR Professor I have a question Okay When the patient has a cardiac arrest if you compress harder wouldnt the heart start beating again You must watch a lot of TV shows What Should we punch the heart with our fist next Like this Like some cool doctor Its not impossible Shocking the heart is also a part of Advanced Life Support Then have you done it yourself too Several times In the field its very common to break the patients ribs during CPR Sometimes you can feel their hearts with your fingertips But despite that if you fail to save the patient you will feel hopeless And youll never get used to it no matter how many times you feel it This process may traumatize some of you here But remember that were medical professionals If theres even a onepercent chance that their hearts can beat again we never give up on our patients Who is it Were in the middle of our lecture Turn off your cell phone You Let me ask you a question too Have you ever done a surgery where you implant a heart that was implanted in someone else You must know better than anyone that its not possible We did it together five years ago with Seokjus heart Should we continue here Its fine by me APPOINTMENT CEREMONY IN NURSING DEPARTMENT BANSEOK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER Should I congratulate you You became a professor after becoming the head of the nursing department You achieved everything you could as

Banseok for years Gu Jingi gave him expensive new drugs that werent covered by the insurance for free So his symptoms improved without any transplant surgery And I looked into the new drugs Patients show great improvement in the beginning But once they develop tolerance when they relapse the symptoms get worse Your son who had to be readmitted to the VIP room makes a good example So what Are you

scared had to say goodbye I would have loved to stay on longer but all is well that ends well Now its pastry week and the remaining six bakers technical skills are put to the test It is a bit tricky Please cook Theyre falling apart But who is next in line for the Star Bakers crown This looks pretty darn good Mmm This is a good way to start the day And who will flake out No Your dough is raw Oh dear Opa Watch any video online with OpenSUBTITLES Free Browser extension osdblinkext It feels good coming off of Star Baker but I feel like the pressures on to maintain a little bit of a status Just to do what I know and kick ass Were down to uh six now and it just keeps getting harder and harder here Im so excited to be here because I got off to this competition in a really rough start so to still be here past the halfway point you know its all I can ask for I have practised so much this week that I injured my elbow which Im calling bakers elbow Good morning bakers and welcome to Pastry Week For this weeks Signature Bake you will be making a slab pie Its a pie that is rectangular as opposed to round and the filling is a fruit of your choice What does that mean for me though More slices per pie Got it Alright bakers you have hours and minutes on the clock On your marks Get set Bake This is just like another day in the kitchen I wanna say but its never like that Im good Well see this Ugh time is of the essence Have you ever made a slab pie before No And so it begins again Its Pastry Week Pastry demands precision control and patience Pastry is so unforgiving Are you a pastry chef Yeah I mean sure Well see after today goes The perfect slab pie with the right ratio of fruit a nice crust you want that contrast of a mushy sweet filling and a nice bit into the dough Im working on the dough right now Oh geez Each baker will bring their own pie crust recipe for this challenge but at the centre of all of them is that one important ingredient I think the perfect pie crust to me is I mean I was raised on my grammys its butter Lots of butter Why butter Because I find that butter will give a crispier crust than shortening or lard I just want chunks of butter just because its better to have more than less Devon is making a plum butter peach and apricot pie decorated to honour a favourite activity with his friends Were a little bit of a uh how do I word this A geeky bunch so we get together we play Dungeons Dragons and I might serve something like this Are you rolling the dice on this one Gee thats a big chunk of butter So this dough now that Ive made it Im just gonna give it one final mix and put it in the freezer just to firm up a bit You see its quite soft and uh thats not gonna be very good when I go to make a pie out of it Sachins pie will be adorned with an elegant peacock and filled with thinly sliced green apples and frangipane Now by using frangipane are you concerned that you wont have enough fruit Uh you know Im using quite a thin layer in there Okay Im not gonna keep it too thick and Im placing a nice layer of apples on top of it So right now Im just rolling out my dough Im kinda like Oh my God oh my God cause Im not a rolling guy Im not the best roller but Ive been working on it Timothys slab pie will showcase a tiny dancer on a curtained stage above a filling of blueberries and banana I dont think Ive ever tried a banana in a pie before No cause usually you only find it in like a banana cream pie What are you gonna do with the banana I just throw it in and you know it No I What does that mean It sounds flippant but I dont mean it like that Getting this big pie to bake in time will be my biggest challenge Its just so goshdarn big The size of the slab pies means theres a real risk of the dreaded soggy bottom Lets get this in there To prevent this most bakers will blind bake their crust before they fill it with fruit But not everyone is using this technique Im not blind baking it No Im just sticking true to how I was raised We dont blind bake pies Real family family tradition Yeah Im trying to represent where I come from Who you are Yeah Megans pie is an ode to her farm depicting the flora and fauna she can see through her window and filled with Saskatoon berries handpicked just outside her door I would like to say I helped picking these Saskatoon berries but I refuse My philosophy is if my husband and kids want me to bake they need to pick The bakers must consider how much juice their fruit will release while it cooks Adding extra liquid should be done with caution So what kind of filling are you using today Im doing something that was very popular among chefs about years ago where they mixed strawberries with balsamic vinegar and pepper Yes Only strawberries Just strawberries Yea so now thats a very juicy fruit Yes Oh yes Andreis Strawberry balsamic slab pie will be decorated in the bold modern fashion of one of his favourite artistic styles Im just doing a sort of like art nouveau inspired strawberry pattern just to show that let me go total strawberry These are Nimbuss best friends Nimbus is my puppy and um she has two best friends Menglings wild blueberry and elderflower pie will depict Nimbus and her doggy BFFs howling at the moon Where did they meet No um Did they go to summer camp together Close Uhhuh anyway Dogs and friends and friends and dogs Okay So I just finished blind baking my crust Oh God okay Uh theres a lot of butter in here Way too much butter Thats not good Its just not baking the way it should have Back in the oven In goes the fruit And on goes the top crust decorations Its going in the oven Cook my pretty Please cook Okay Thirty minutes remain Its my dogs While everyone else waits for their pies to bake Devon is just starting to assemble Okay I am sweating What can I do to help I can make some dice for you Dice Yeah sure How many do you want Um just all of it Oh wow Im just using the tip just to cut out circles Thanks Andrei I really appreciate it When do I get to sample something Oh Guess what Youre a star Its just pie crust Mmm Okay do your best Twenty minutes bakers Twenty minutes remain Devon how much how much uh fat did you put into your pie In general like how much Theres a lot Way too much butter Whats happening Well were smoking Is that a good thing Um not usually Are you doing a smoky pie A smoked pie Yeah thats right Its gonna taste smoky Well its a dragon Its a big freaking pie Right Are you feeling confident When do I ever feel confident in this tent Julia Its true Not too shabby theres five minutes remaining on your slabbies Game time I think thats done Okay Im pulling it Its a little runny Wow that could be a weapon its so hot Okay Agh Oh Bakers you have one minute left Look at it go So liquidy Thats not good Time is up bakers Hands off your slabs please Okay The slab pies will now be judged by Bruno and Rochelle Do you know Timothy one ballerina under the spotlight with the drapes of the stage it just looks so spectacular Thank you Did you blind bake this For around twenty minutes Twenty minutes is just like warming it up If youre blind baking youre blind baking to bake it through You can see this layer of translucent Yeah Its not baked enough Okay Im just gonna go with the top Yeah Ive never done a pie with banana in it Um but the flavour works Thanks guys This looks and smells divine Mm Yep Good bake Thats a perfect slab pie for me Thank you The pastry at the bottom is beautifully crispy The fruit is sweet but not overly sweet And look at that shine Its beautiful Thank you very much Yes really good Well done Thank you Sachin I can see great concept However its a bit lost in the lack of contrast I wanted a bit more pop with my little peacock No totally I see that You got great flavour with the apple but you have so much dough on the top Yeah So you dont have the distinct apple taste The frangipanes made it really cakelike Okay and pie is fruit and pastry Okay I cannot see clearly the dragon Yeah I agree Oh boy Your dough is raw But you blind baked this I did but there was just too much butter in the dough Its a shame that its really underbaked Yeah Nimbus Cali and Maisy Maisy okay I just love the design However its lacking a bit of bake in this part And youve got a bit of bleed here Yeah Oh dear I mean the fruits holding Thats a good sign This is sensational Oh yes This is really elegant The wild blueberries are so punchy And youve got a good ratio of filling A lot of fruit which is good Yeah a lot of fruit Thank you I love that youve used the meringue Its a nice little extra Thanks It looks wet And your dough is not cooked at all Yeah Yeah I can see youre so upset I am Sorry Its gonna be great The flavours amazing Okay good The Amaretto with the lemon and the Saskatoon berries is just perfect The three of them are perfect together Should I have blind baked it But my grammy told me not to Maybe dont listen to Grammy Shes so cute though For once Only for once Shes so cute Its just frustrating Still tasted good Still looked pretty Its okay Im pretty disappointed I mean its entirely my fault I have no one to blame but myself Ive never made a slab pie before but now I have and if I have to go to like a person gathering I know what to bring now Its time to get technical And technically Bruno Rochelle youre not really supposed to be here but before you leave any words of advice Remember keep your cool Thank you so much Thank you Thank you very much Bye Okay so this next challenge is extremely delicate fussy and flaky Kind of like you Dan Gonna choose to take that as a compliment Julia Do You have been asked to bake sweet and savoury palmiers Oh no These French puff pastries are light layered and in a precarious palm shape Palm You have hours and minutes On your marks Get set Bake Oh my God Making palmiers Palmeers Palmees Palm trees Do you know what they are No So Bruno its Pastry Wseek Were asking our bakers to make us palmier Why Well every baker should know how to make a rough puff Which gives us a similar result to a more traditional puff pastry Flaky crispy and buttery So you can see all the layers of the dough You can see the perfect bake Mmhm Its crispy very light and has a good taste of butter Mmm We need to get them to make sweet which is very traditional but weve thrown them a curveball and were asking them to make us a savoury version Super delicious The most important thing about a palmier is the the shape Its a heart with a round bottom And so if our bakers dont know what a palmier is there in real trouble this week arent they Yes thats Pastry Week Do you know about the rough puff Done that before Ive made rough puff but not frequently so Okay Rough puff pastry is quicker to make than traditional flaky pastry which usually takes hours A food processor is used to incorporate the butter into the flour But it comes with a risk If the butter is overpulsed it will prevent the dough from puffing up in the oven I think I maybe missed half a cup of flour Maybe Are we familiar with palmier And you know growing up theyre one of our favourites Oh great Used to have this little place in Halifax called The French Pastry Shop It was like an oldschool pastry shop and my father used to take us Well its really good that you know what they should taste like I do Alright my love This is gonna be fun Good luck Yeah thank you Working up a sweat because cold dough is hard to roll Once the dough is ready the bakers need to do three rounds of rolling folding and chilling Okay But if they do more than three turns the pastry will be overworked and wont puff That was turn five and now Im gonna do turn six now This is number four I saw Andrei doing this I trust Andrei Hes my friend He knows what hes doing Thats my strategy for this technical Im blessed that hes in front of me I dont really know what to do with this bad boy The savoury palmiers will be filled with speck and Gruyere cheese I like that combination I dont even know what speck is Its ham right Yeah Its a kinda like cured ham Its tasty Yeah Okay Delicious The sweet ones are sprinkled with sugar Oh God I still dont know what these look like Have you seen them before No Im just gonna make them look like trees Some people call them elephant ears cause they look like the shape of an elephant ear To achieve the classic palmier shape the dough must be folded not rolled I have made the shape of a palmier which requires you to fold it three times then flop it over Uh cut to perfect thickness and place on prepared sheets and eggwash if needed for browning These are the sweet palmiers Just trying for consistency If we get there I dont know Oh geez Theyre falling apart Oh I think maybe Andrei has the right idea His palmiers are more like more thin Less Princess Leia Goin in the oven I hope they look okay Those look like palmier Do they Yeah I still dont really know what they are I dont think anyone really does or why they exist Palmyay Were almost done Minute and a half bakers No I have extras I have spares Oh Do they look cooked Theyre a puff pastry disaster Are they They just didnt puff as much as they should Do they look baked Theyre so pale Look at these little nuggets They should be nice and flaky and crisp Careful you dont burn yourself Ow Five seconds Palms in the air bakers Time is up Please bring your palmier up to the gingham altar and place them behind your photo The judges will be looking for the correct shape flaky pastry and a good bake First baker The classic palmier shape is like of a heart with no point at the bottom You need to fold your pastry in order to create that sort of elongated palmier shape as opposed to rolling the pastry inwards Lets try the sweet one first Yes Its beautifully baked Very flaky Beautiful buttery flavours Lets try the savoury one Nice snap You can see Nice crispy light And thats because of a nice lamination of the dough Excellent effort Second example Theyre quite thick Its undercooked The sweet ones Its not as flaky as I expect with a laminated dough This was pulsed a little too far Third baker This baker has actually folded the pastry which is really nice to see Its a bit tight Mmm You dont have much Puff You can see I have to fight it a little to break it Beautifully laminated but overworked The savoury one Its lacking some flavour I would have used more cheese Fourth baker The shape is not perfect but there is definitely a nice bake Lets try the sweet ones Uh the sweet ones Its too thick and its undercooked in the middle Fifth baker The texture of the dough just by looking at it is not right And it was clearly pulsed way too long in the food processor Lacks a lot of sugar therefore the flavour is onedimensional Its kind of flat Last but not least The outside layer is crispy and nice The inside is a bit dense Lets try the savoury one Very flaky and very nice and it has a good flavour Really tasty Bruno and Rochelle will share their assessment by ranking the palmiers from last to first In sixth place whose are these Devon Well yeah The dough was too dense Not enough sugar Wrong shape Yeah In fifth place Timothy These were Yeah quite doughy Yeah In fourth place Whose are these Megan The roll was inconsistent with a lot of holes in the sweet ones So in third place whose are these Andrei Great shape perfect shape but they were really just dry and tough from overworking the pastry In second place whose are these Sachin Good amount of sugar good flavour and crispy And in first place whose are these Mengling Youve had a cracker of a day Well done Thanks Yay me I got first in the Technical for the first time Im really happy I knew how to make palmiers so Im going to be annoyed about it but its not going to cause any problem in the future I dont think Looking forward I have a bit of a reputation as somebody who does well in Showstoppers so hopefully I can stay focused What would you say is the most important thing that these bakers should keep in mind going into this last challenge They need to forget everything that they did yesterday and focus on today and just give us their Agame and I think every single one of our bakers today realizes whats at stake No one is safe Good morning bakers Today the judges would like you to make breakfast pastries Specifically six danish six croissant and six sweet buns Now the croissant and danish can be made both sweet or savoury but the sweet buns should be well they should be sweet Thats right You have four and a half hours to make the breakfast basket of my dreams On your marks Get set Bake Have at er mixer Little knocked down yesterday Little knocked down Yeah yesterday wasnt a great day Today I just want to have fun Today we are asking our bakers to present us with a basket of breakfast pastries Time management is going to be the trickiest part of todays challenge I mean I just thought like What would I want for breakfast Like if I had a big day coming up like thats what I want Pastry is one of the most important skills you need to know as a baker The tricky part is your dough Is it fluffy Is it overproofed Underproofed A lot of things to worry about You know the worst that can happen is my dough is underlaminated and underproofed and underbaked you know Creating pastries with two different doughs and three different shapes and flavours is going to push the bakers to their limits I am doing my croissants and danish first because that one is the hardest dough to make I just decided to start with croissant because C comes before D in the alphabet or something I dont know Andreis Breakfast in Paris pastry basket will include a cocoastripe croissant an apricot danish and a swirly sweet bun Itll be like a pecancinnamon scroll No raisins No I didnt put raisins in it No Alright Its for the best Im not a raisin guy Yeah but this Not that this is about me but I Thank God I am stupidly obsessed with anything pear Im doing pear danish with a its called caged pear So theres actually a lattice cut top on top so it looks like the pears caged trying to break free Megans pear danishes will be partnered with hibiscus croissants while her husbands favourite coconutlime buns will round out her breakfast basket What is breakfast like in your home full of hungry hungry boys and man We dont do a lot of pastries for breakfast I usually have egg whites every morning Its very boring Well this is a bit more decadent than that Little bit I love the feel of this dough Its stretchysoft Smells awesome Croissant and danish dough must be laminated meaning that the butter is folded multiple times into the dough to create alternating layers So it hasnt really incorporated the butter very well I did cut it and you can see layers which is generally a good sign The number of folds or turns determines how flaky the pastry will be This is gonna be my third turn Ive done two folds two turns Im just gonna do two more Timing is gonna be really tight so Im only doing two turns Menglings twoturn dough will be shaped into yuzu croissants and strawberry cream cheese danishes Maplepecan sweet buns will complete her breakfast basket Im working on my sweet roll dough It is quite sticky but its okay its supposed to be Im not sure if its supposed to be this sticky though What did I come over here for Your danishes I dont know Eggs Goshdarn it This whole challenge seems very Christmassy to me because I dont have much time to make croissants on a regular day but during the holidays lots of time I am doing an almond croissant My favourite my moms favourite Along with almond croissants Sachins Christmas morning feast will include an orange spice sweet bun and a smoked cheddar danish I love laminated doughs I love croissants I worked at a bakery and would have two every morning Yeah And then regretted it deeply by the end of the summer Lets just put it that way Just a helpful hint bakers You have two hours remaining Finally the shaping of the pastries can begin Im using black cocoa to put a coloured stripe in my croissants I just have to laminate it to the croissant when I do the final shaping It is a bit tricky This is the morning bun filling Not too tight not too loose This is pretty darn good Im making a chocolate espresso covered croissant Theres chocolate covered espresso beans on top Its breakfast So I think you have to start with coffee right Devons breakfast pastries include chocolate espresso croissants and savoury Swiss chard danishes And hell make a hazelnut chocolate bun out of the leftover dough Growing up we would never waste scraps of dough so I wanted to pay homage to my mom and where I come from Thats really lovely Great Good luck Thanks Mines gonna be an almond croissant Im just creating the little danish cages for my mushroom filling I dont know if its too soft Orangecinnamon sweet bun Is that the stress release ball No no no This is cookie dough Im making melonpan or Hong Kong Pineapple bun so its Okay Oh Yeah I know those Its the bread thats covered by a cookie so you get kind of like a crunch on the outside and the sweetness of the cookie plus the softness of the bread inside And theyre gonna be decorated like bears Like what Like bears I hope its cute Timothys bearshaped sweet buns will be paired with almond croissants and caramelized onion and mushroom danishes Its a pretty good breakfast Its a hearty breakfast Its a good way to start the day While the shaped pastries are proofing the bakers work on fillings and toppings Cream chard for my danish I love cream chard Mushrooms thyme its awesome Ontario strawberries Im making a creme patissiere A lot of egg yolks and cornstarch and sugar and vanilla which I forgot to put in You have one hour left Time for the pastries to get ready for the oven Im working on the cream cheese filling for my danishes Strawberry jam and cheese Mmm Smoked cheddar Im making an apricot and pistachio danish My dainty man hands dont make this process very easy Okay alright Okay go Be free pretty things Turn it up Im shocking it with high heat so I can get all that butter and all the different layers to explode Its so nervewracking trying to figure out when to take them out Mmm Bakers this is your twominute warning Oh yeah Let em cool Megan Let em cool Oh Lord help me Oh dear Mmm Its breakfast You have one minute remaining Ugh So imbalanced Would you like to try some almond croissant If you like almond croissant Oh wow that was a bite Mmm Nice and crispy Mmm Thats ugly Thats awful Oh my God that feels nice Five seconds Alright bakers time is up Breakfast is served Opa The judges will now sample the breakfast pastries to decide who will get Star Baker and who will have to go home Sachin your pastries please The aromas coming off this are beautiful Thank you Were gonna start with the croissant I can see the lamination Great flavour Great And a lot of butter Thank you Next mushroom and cheddar danish Mushroom and smoked cheddar yeah You can see all the layers almost like a book The choice of smoked cheese is very clever Thank you Your orangecinnamon sweet bun Look at those layers It just opens Great Showstopper Thank you so much Im taking those home tonight I love the rustic presentation Oh my gosh Thank you So its cardamomyuzu croissants I can see that its laminated its just not laminated enough How many turns did you do in this croissant dough I just did two Minimum three And because it wasnt laminated enough your dough does not cook properly inside Did you do that because youve tried that before or you were running out of time or Um I thought that was one step that I could cut for timing Thats the thing with pastry You cannot cut corners Mmhm The maplepecan sweet buns Yes Good flavours Slightly overbaked as you can see These are your strawberry and cream cheese danish Taste is great Too bad you dont have that flakiness Mengling some technical problems Dont cut corners So these are your coconut and lime sweet buns Yes Clean flavours A lot of coconut so its very delightful Next is your pear and cinnamon danish Youve put this beautiful delicate lattice on the top They have created this lovely cage Great flavour Your pears are poached to perfection Beautiful The chocolate and hibiscus croissant Its very heavy and almost breadlike Oh I think its lacking moisture Oh okay So not enough liquid Your dough is To give that puff The flavours are really good Yeah and again overall great presentation Lovely Okay thank you Devon its a lovely brunch presentation Thank you So its your chard and gruyere Yeah danish So you got a beautiful bake all over The gruyere and the chard work really nicely together Theres not a lot of flake happening here I had some real challenges with my dough today Remember when you make pastries youve got to have it right from the beginning Yeah Ive learned that this week The croissant The croissants Does not have the flakiness What saves you here was your flavour So the sweet buns Chocolate hazelnut spread with pecans These were um made with the scrap dough from the croissant and the danish You can taste the chocolate and the nuts However its scrap dough of dough that wasnt perfect to begin with Great flavours Oh thank you Thank you so much If I was in Paris and if I call room service to get breakfast thats what I will get And you can see the swirls Um wow Youve nailed lamination Okay Okay good The texture is amazing I just wanna big pot of jam and just its a really good croissant Thank you So this is your apricot and pistachio danish Yes From the side you can see the layers that puffed up Beautifully laminated layers Now there is nothing better than eating a sour apricot and a cr\\u00c3me patissiere Oh I know The contrast just collide and explode Marry Its just beautiful Cinnamon sweet buns You could almost peel every layer one by one Let me ask you something did you ever consider moving to Paris opening your own little bakery No Maybe you should You pushed yourself and it showed So thank you so much Incredible skills Yeah Thank you Mm Go on a bear hunt Very cute Instagram worthy So this is the cookie dough on the outside and then on the inside is the sweet bun dough Yes Your dough reminds me of a German stollen Oh yeah Raisins Mmhm Orange zest These are your almost croissant Yes Thats a really great croissant Okay thank you So we have a mushroommozzarella onion danish They smell divine Great flavours Okay What youve produced is really impressive Thank you Good job So this was a really tough challenge that yielded some pretty amazing results So who really impressed you out of the bunch I think Andrei overall was a rock star Sachin also delivered technically brilliant pastry Timothy was very playful yet very professional And he was really ambitious Megan she knew she needed to up her game and she did Mengling had a really good day yesterday and today was a little rough on her Today she cut corners and it shows Devon had a lot of challenges this week and we obviously have to look at him At this stage were heading into the quarterfinals and we really need to make sure that the five that go through are our strongest bakers Well congratulations bakers on successfully surviving Pastry Week Weve tested your precision weve tested your patience and now we have the very sweet task of telling you who is this weeks Star Baker Now this baker has impressed us from the start but today produced pastry

home The baker that will we will be saying very sadly goodbye to today is Devon Im so sad to see you go Thank you This experience has taught me to you know take risks and to try new things and to not be so worried about the outcome Im this guy from a small town in Saskatchewan and its been incredible What an experience Well Devon always delivered great flavours but this week we were looking for exceptional pastry techniques But he brought a lot to the tent Amazing guy Andrei is just nextlevel Hes so incredibly thorough So were going into the quarterfinals This is the second time Andreis been awarded Star Baker Our other bakers better watch out Being Star Baker this week means a lot to me After Bruno and Rochelles comments about the quality of my baking is really overwhelming Im gonna

was in turmoil It was the age of war Nations battled for power and to increase their territories During this age of war ninjas consisted of individual clans serving as armed units They were hired by various nations to participate in the fighting And among the many ninja clans two were feared as the strongest One was us the Uchiha clan And the othe', ' strongest One was us the Uchiha clan And the other was known as the Forests Senju Clan We of the Uchiha clan possessed exceptional chakra and the Sharingan Excelling in all types of warfare we became known as a battle clan And I was born into the Uchiha clan possessing chakra that was especially powerful Perhaps the fact that Ive lived this long is proof of that Back in those days all I did was battle In an age defined by power I sought to become ever stronger and killed my friends and even my ', 'e ever stronger and killed my friends and even my younger brother Why you As a result I came into possession of the perfect Mangekyo Sharingan and became the leader of the Uchiha And using that power I fought the Senju clan countless times It was inevitable that I face Hashirama the leader of the Senju clan Wood Style Hashirama Senju the future first Hokage The one who stood at the top of the ninja world And the one I respected most The Senju clan led by Hashirama who became the First Hokage was', 'n led by Hashirama who became the First Hokage was feared and respected by all the other clans If the Senju moved so did the Uchiha Our clan was probably the only clan able to compete with them If a nation hired the Senju

your reputation You took your younger brothers eyes just for that I did take them', 'ounger brothers eyes just for that I did take them But I needed power in order to protect the Uchiha Protect Yes As

because its better to have more than less Devon is m', 'cause its better to have more than less Devon is making a plum butter peach and apricot pie decorated to honour a favourite activity with his friends Were a little bit of a uh how do I word this A geeky bunch so we get together we play Dungeons Dragons and I might serve something like this Are you rolling the dice on this one Gee thats a big chunk of butter So this dough now that Ive made it Im just gonna give it one final mix and put it in the freezer just to firm up a bit You see its quite sof', 'reezer just to firm up a bit You see its quite soft and uh thats not gonna be very good when I go to make a pie out of it Sachins pie will be adorned with an elegant peacock and filled with thinly sliced green apples and frangipane Now

only find it in like a banana cream pie What are you gonna do with the banana I just throw it in and you know it No I What does that mean It sounds flippant but I dont mean', ' does that mean It sounds flippant but I dont mean it like that Getting this big pie to bake in time will be my biggest challenge Its just so goshdarn big The size of the slab pies means theres a real risk of the dreaded soggy bottom Lets get this in there To prevent this most bakers will blind bake their crust before they fill it with fruit But not everyone is using this technique Im not blind baking it No Im just sticking true to how I was raised We dont blind bake pies Real family family trad', 'ed We dont blind bake pies Real family family tradition Yeah Im trying to represent where I come from Who you are Yeah Megans pie is an ode to her farm depicting the flora and fauna she can see through her window and filled with Saskatoon berries handpicked just outside her door I would like to say I helped picking these Saskatoon berries but I refuse My philosophy is if my husband and kids want me to bake they need to pick The bakers must consider how much juice their fruit will release while i', 'er how much juice their fruit will release while it cooks Adding extra liquid should be done with caution So what kind of filling are you using today Im doing something that was very popular among chefs about years ago where they mixed strawberries with balsamic vinegar and pepper Yes Only strawberries Just strawberries Yea so now thats a very juicy fruit Yes Oh yes Andreis Strawberry balsamic slab

However its a bit lost in the lack of contrast I wanted a bit more pop with my little peacock No totally I see that You got great flavour with the apple but you have so much dough on the top Yeah So

Thank you so much Thank you Thank you very much Bye Okay so this next challenge is extremely delicate fussy and flaky Kind of like you Dan Gonna choose to take that as a compliment Julia Do You have been asked to bake sweet and savoury palmiers Oh no These French puff pastries are light layered and in a precarious palm shape Palm You have hours and minutes On your marks Get set Bake Oh my God Making palmiers Palmeers Palmees Palm trees Do you know what they are No So Bruno its', 'lm trees Do you know what they are No So Bruno its Pastry Wseek Were asking our bakers to make us palmier Why Well every baker should know how to make a rough puff Which gives us a similar result to a more traditional puff pastry Flaky crispy and buttery So you can see all the layers of the dough You can see the perfect bake Mmhm Its crispy very light and has a good taste of butter Mmm We need to get them to make sweet which is very traditional but weve thrown them a curveball and were asking th', 'ut weve thrown them a curveball and were asking them to make us a savoury version Super delicious The most important thing about a palmier is the the shape Its a heart with a round bottom And so if our bakers dont know what a palmier is there in real trouble this week arent they Yes thats Pastry Week Do you know about the rough puff Done that before Ive made rough puff but not frequently so Okay Rough puff pastry is quicker to make than traditional flaky pastry which usually takes hours A food p', 'al flaky pastry which usually takes hours A food processor is used to incorporate the butter into the flour But it comes with a risk If the butter is overpulsed it will prevent the dough from puffing up in the oven I think I maybe missed half a cup of flour Maybe Are we familiar with palmier And you know growing up theyre one of our favourites Oh great Used to have this little place in Halifax called The French Pastry Shop It was like an oldschool pastry shop and my father used to take us Well i', 'l pastry shop and my father used to take us Well its really good that you know what they should taste like I do Alright my love This is gonna be fun Good luck Yeah thank you Working up a sweat because cold dough is hard to roll Once the dough is ready the bakers need to do three rounds of rolling folding and chilling Okay But if they do more than three turns the pastry will be overworked and wont puff That was turn five and now Im gonna do turn six now This is number four I saw Andrei doing this', 'ix now This is number four I saw Andrei doing this I trust Andrei Hes my friend He knows what hes doing Thats my strategy for this technical Im blessed that hes in front of me I dont really know what to do with this bad boy The savoury palmiers will be filled with speck and Gruyere cheese I like that combination I dont even know what speck is Its ham right Yeah Its a kinda like cured ham Its tasty Yeah Okay Delicious The sweet ones are sprinkled with sugar Oh God I still dont know what these loo', 'with sugar Oh God I still dont know what these look like Have you seen them before No Im just gonna make them look like trees Some people call them elephant ears cause they look like the shape of an elephant ear To achieve the classic palmier shape the dough must be folded not rolled I have made the shape of a palmier which requires you to fold it three times then flop it over Uh cut to perfect thickness and place on prepared sheets and eggwash if needed for browning These are the sweet palmiers', 'f needed for browning These are the sweet palmiers Just trying for consistency If we get there I dont know Oh geez Theyre falling apart Oh I think maybe Andrei has the right idea His palmiers are more like more thin Less Princess Leia Goin in the oven I hope they look okay Those look like palmier Do they Yeah I still dont really know what they are I dont think anyone really does or why they exist Palmyay Were almost done Minute and a half bakers No I have extras I have spares Oh Do they look coo', 'No I have extras I have spares Oh Do they look cooked Theyre a puff pastry disaster Are they They just didnt puff as much as they should Do they look baked Theyre so pale Look at these little nuggets They should be nice and flaky and crisp Careful you dont burn yourself Ow Five seconds Palms in the air bakers Time is up Please bring your palmier up to the gingham altar and place them behind your photo The judges will be looking for the correct shape flaky pastry and a good bake First baker The c', 'ape flaky pastry and a good bake First baker The classic palmier shape is like of a heart with no point at the bottom You need to fold your pastry in order to create that sort of elongated palmier shape as opposed to rolling the pastry inwards Lets try the sweet one first Yes Its beautifully baked Very flaky Beautiful buttery flavours Lets try the savoury one Nice snap You can see Nice crispy light And thats because of a nice lamination of the dough Excellent effort Second example Theyre quite t', 'ugh Excellent effort Second example Theyre quite thick Its undercooked The sweet ones Its not as flaky as I expect with a laminated dough This was pulsed a little too far Third baker This baker has actually folded the pastry which is really nice to see Its a bit tight Mmm You dont have much Puff You can see I have to fight it a little to break it Beautifully laminated but overworked The savoury one Its lacking some flavour I would have used more cheese Fourth baker The shape is not perfect but t', 'cheese Fourth baker The shape is not perfect but there is definitely a nice bake Lets try the sweet ones Uh the sweet ones Its too thick and its undercooked in the middle Fifth baker The texture of the dough just by looking at it is not right And it was clearly pulsed way too long in the food processor Lacks a lot of sugar therefore the flavour is onedimensional Its kind of flat Last but not least The outside layer is crispy and nice The inside is a bit dense Lets try the savoury one Very flaky ', 's a bit dense Lets try the savoury one Very flaky and very nice and it has a good flavour Really tasty Bruno and Rochelle will share their assessment by ranking the palmiers from last to first In sixth place whose are these Devon Well yeah The dough was too dense Not enough sugar Wrong shape Yeah In fifth place Timothy These were Yeah quite doughy Yeah In fourth place Whose are these Megan The roll was inconsistent with a lot of holes in the sweet ones So in third place whose are these Andrei Gr', 't ones So in third place whose are these Andrei Great shape perfect shape but they were really just dry and tough from overworking the pastry In second place whose are these Sachin Good amount of sugar good flavour and crispy And in first place whose are these Mengling Youve had a cracker of a day Well done Thanks Yay me I got first in the Technical for the first time Im really happy I knew how to make palmiers so Im going to be annoyed about it but its not going to cause any problem in the futu', 'but its not going to cause any problem in the future I dont think Looking forward I have a bit of a reputation as somebody who does well in Showstoppers so hopefully I can stay focused What would you say is the most important thing that these bakers should keep in mind going into this last challenge They need to forget everything that they did yesterday and focus on today and just give us their Agame and I think every single one of our bakers today realizes whats at stake No one is safe Good mor', 'ay realizes whats at stake No one is safe Good morning bakers Today the judges would like you to make breakfast pastries Specifically six danish six croissant and six sweet buns Now the croissant and danish can be made both sweet or savoury but the sweet buns should be well they should be sweet Thats right You have four and a half hours to make the breakfast basket of my dreams On your marks Get

we are asking our bakers to present us with a basket of breakfast pastries Time management is going to be the trickiest part of todays challenge I mean I just thought like What would I want for breakfast Like if I had a big day coming up like thats what I want Pastry is one of the most important skills you need to know as a baker The tricky part is your dough Is it fluffy Is it overproofed Underproofed ', 'dough Is it fluffy Is it overproofed Underproofed A lot of things to worry about You know the worst that can happen is my dough is underlaminated and underproofed and underbaked you know Creating pastries with two different doughs and three different shapes and flavours is going to push the bakers to their limits I am doing my croissants and danish first because that one is the hardest dough to make I just decided to start with croissant because C comes before D in the alphabet or something I do', 'C comes before D in the alphabet or something I dont know Andreis Breakfast in Paris pastry basket will include a cocoastripe croissant an apricot danish and a swirly sweet bun Itll be like a pecancinnamon scroll No raisins No I didnt put raisins in it No Alright Its for the

have egg whites every morning Its very boring Well this is a bit more decadent than that Little bit I love the feel of this dough Its', ' that Little bit I love the feel of this dough Its stretchysoft Smells awesome Croissant and danish dough must be laminated meaning that the butter is folded multiple times into the dough to create alternating layers So it hasnt really incorporated the butter very well I did cut it and you can see layers which is generally a good sign The number of folds or turns determines how flaky the pastry will be This is gonna be my third turn Ive done two folds two turns Im just gonna do two more Timing i', 'folds two turns Im just gonna do two more Timing is gonna be really tight so Im only doing two turns Menglings twoturn dough will be shaped into yuzu croissants

kidding Ill say it once more You think you know about your brother but you know nothing If you continue speaking such nonsense Ill kill you Youre not making this easy are you I suppose thats natural though Suddenly being told such a story by a stranger like me But what I tell you is the truth Itachi did mention it did he not About his accomplice that night I am that Madara Uchiha I know everything about Itachi I suppose Itachi died without realizing that Shut up Such things dont matter anymore Just get out of my sight No you will listen You need to hear this Its your obligation For the sake of the ninja world For the sake of the Hidden Leaf Village And for your sake Your brother risked everything You will know how Itachi Uchiha lived Do you know why Why Itachi implanted Amaterasu into your eye Itachi was determined to make sure that you and I would not meet You will understand why as well as everything else when you hear me out Those who knew the truth about Itachi were Danzo of the Hidden Leaf the Third Hokage and his advisors Homura and Koharu Just those four The Third Hokage died and now there are only three aging folk Still those three will probably never reveal the abominable truth The truth about Itachi will fade into darkness forever And that is what Itachi wished However I know the truth about Itachi too As I said earlier Itachi died without realizing that However he wanted to make doubly sure It seems Itachi did not trust me So just in case I did know the truth he planned to silence me with the Amaterasu He probably anticipated I would show my Sharingan in order to speak to you What is this What is this guy saying Protect me Protect The truth Think back Think carefully and remember about Itachi Watch any video online with OpenSUBTITLES Free Browser extension osdblinkext About your kind brother Whats wrong This is it right The place where Father works This is the headquarters of the Hidden Leaf Police Force Ive always been curious Why is the Uchiha crest on the police force logo What You noticed that Who wouldnt Welllets see Simply put it seems our ancestors formed and organized this police force And so they used our family crest as the symbol of this organization From ages past our clan has been entrusted with the safety of the village The Uchiha crest reflects the pride of our clan While its numbers have dwindled even today nearly everyone in the clan serves on Squad One and is dedicated to preserving the peace and safety of the village After all only exceptional ninja are capable of preventing crimes that ninja commit Father is great after all Are you going to work here too I wonder about that You should No he He tried to kill me He tried to take my eyes Who would do such a thing Foolish little brother Mangekyo Sharingan Calm down Breathe slowly Dont touch me Even if you do hate me Thats what big brothers are for Sorry Sasuke Another time Fate Youre awake Sorry but I took the liberty of tying you up Since you werent gonna stay still and listen to me He Itachi was my enemy He killed our parents He killed everyone in the clan He was a Rogue Ninja A member of the Akatsuki He was despicable He was my target Its true that he annihilated the Uchiha clan that night And he deserted the Hidden Leaf Then And that is what he was ordered to do by the Hidden Leaf That is the beginning of the truth about Itachi It was his mission Yes That night Itachi killed his personal feelings and fulfilled his mission It seems youve calmed down a bit What are you talking about In order to talk about Itachi I must take you back to the early days when Hidden Leaf Village was founded Itachi sacrificed himself This is fate that has continued since ages past He was sacrificed for it Sacrifice Thats correct A huge problem rooted since the time Hidden Leaf Village was founded That is what determined Itachis life Its a long story but everything I tell you is the truth On what basis should I believe you Youre untrustworthy Theres nothing I can show you as proof And its up to you whether you believe me or not But you will hear me out until I finish Fine So talk It all started more than years ago The world was in turmoil It was the age of war Nations battled for power and to increase their territories During this age of war ninjas consisted of individual clans serving as armed units They were hired by various nations to participate in the fighting And among the many ninja clans two were feared as the strongest One was us the Uchiha clan And the other was known as the Forests Senju Clan We of the Uchiha clan possessed exceptional chakra and the Sharingan Excelling in all types of warfare we became known as a battle clan And I was born into the Uchiha clan possessing chakra that was especially powerful Perhaps the fact that Ive lived this long is proof of that Back in those days all I did was battle In an age defined by power I sought to become ever stronger and killed my friends and even my younger brother Why you As a result I came into possession of the perfect Mangekyo Sharingan and became the leader of the Uchiha And using that power I fought the Senju clan countless times It was inevitable that I face Hashirama the leader of the Senju clan Wood Style Hashirama Senju the future first Hokage The one who stood at the top of the ninja world And the one I respected most The Senju clan led by Hashirama who became the First Hokage was feared and respected by all the other clans If the Senju moved so did the Uchiha Our clan was probably the only clan able to compete with them If a nation hired the Senju the opposing nation would hire the Uchiha We were like rivals The more I went up against Hashirama the more my name became known as well To get close to the top to measure my abilities To heighten your reputation You took your younger brothers eyes just for that I did take them But I needed power in order to protect the Uchiha Protect Yes As the Uchiha name spread its enemies increased It was a necessary sacrifice to protect the clan during the fierce fighting with the Senju and the other clans It was not for my fame My younger brother was in total agreement and offered his eyes to me But one day the Senju clan offered a truce And the Uchiha accepted it Everyone in both clans had grown weary of the fighting that had dragged on for so long They had enough But I I was the only one who opposed it Where has all the hate gone For what purpose had my brother sacrificed himself The Uchiha and Senju are like oil and water I couldnt help fearing that in time the Uchiha clan would come to be oppressed by the Senju clan Howevereveryone in the Uchiha clan wanted a truce As their leader I had no choice but to go along with their wishes Shortly thereafter the ninja alliance signed a pact with the Land of Fire which had sought dominion over the territories The secure one nation one village system was formed and became the Land of Fire and the Village Hidden in the Leaves Other countries adopted the one nation one village system And subsequently the fires of war were extinguished Momentary peace But due to a certain incident the Hidden Leaf Village quickly descended into turmoil A certain incident A fightfor the First Hokages seat As you know the first to occupy that seat was Hashirama Senju The Land of Fire and the entire clan chose Hashirama It was inevitable that the Uchihas hold on the reins of power would loosen I decided that the Uchiha should take leadership That we should confront Hashirama But no one not even from the Uchiha clan supported me My subordinates who did not wish to light the fires of war were unsympathetic and betrayed me I was accused of acting out of greed and selfinterest Not only that They scorned me as a selfish brother who stole his younger brothers eyes in order to save his own What brother would willfully hurt his younger brother I justI just wanted to protect the Uchiha I left the village Everyone betrayed me I became an avenger and declared war on the Hidden Leaf Village And I lost At that place which became known as the Final Valley I was saidto have died there Even Hashirama believed it And everyone forgot about me History forgot about me Hashiramas younger brother who became the Second Hokage was determined that there would never be a traitor like me again So as proof of his trust he granted the Uchiha a special position And he created the Hidden Leaf Police Force But the truth is This was to further distance the Uchiha from the reins of government Furthermore it was a way to keep a close eye on the entire clan There were Uchiha members who realized this Members who wanted to carry on my rebellion Butit was too late Time passed The Senju clan solidified its hold on power and the Uchiha fell to becoming Senju dogs And what I predicted came to pass A certain other incident sealed Uchihas figurative demise Yes The attack of the NineTailed Fox Demon years ago What do you mean The NineTails can only be tamed and controlled by the ocular powers of the Uchiha The higherups of Hidden Leaf Village perceived the Uchiha to be behind this attack That was a natural occurrence a natural calamity The Uchiha had nothing to do with it Yet suspicion fell on them That the Uchiha had revolted and sought to take power As a result the Uchiha was put under the strict surveillance of the Anbu Black Ops and they were forced to relocate to the outskirts of the village They became totally estranged The Third Hokage was the only one to voice opposition to our treatment But Danzo of the Anbu Black Ops and the rest of the councilors would not listen In the end the Uchiha clan was not trusted And the discrimination began Their distrust bred hatred and eventually their suspicions became reality The Uchiha clan plotted a coup d\\u00c3tat to take over the village The higherups in Hidden Leaf Village planted a spy within the Uchiha clan That spy was your older brother Itachi Uchiha From that moment Itachis suffering began You laid false charges against the Uchiha Thats Itachis lie I wont believe it Itachi tried to kill me If he really wanted to you certainly would be dead However Stop it Ive had enough You should know why Because you are Next time on Naruto Shippuden Truth That is Itachis truth Tune in again Support us and become VIP member to remove all ads from wwwOpenSubtitlesorg\",\n          \"THE NAMES OF PEOPLE INCIDENTS AND BACKGROUNDS OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL The doctor changed I remember clearly I saw it and heard it myself The doctor The doctor changed during the surgery I think we need the head surgeon here I told you The VIP is here so he cant come This is too dangerous The tumor is in an odd location so if we cut it here we might hurt her nerves Director Gu Hyunseong left her with us So you wont do a thing Will you take responsibility Assistant Director is the patient awake That was shocking Her tape came off I was frightened I hoped it was just a nightmare Does Banseok University Medical Center know that she remembers the ghost surgery No They wont even hear us out We went a few times to complain but they wouldnt even let us in Thats why we came to see you What a relief Sorry We can win this case Soyeon from today until your trial you wont remember that the doctor changed during the surgery No I saw and heard everything Plaintiff The surgeon in charge wasnt there and a different surgeon did my surgery Plaintiff Calm down If you cause any more disturbance you will be removed Watch any video online with OpenSUBTITLES Free Browser extension osdblinkext Then it mustve been a ghost A ghost What kind of nonsense The victim saw it but no other surgeon did the surgery Then the only answer is that it was a ghost An operation room ghost that doctors at Banseok cant see This is false information Please stop speaking Sustained Counsel for the plaintiff Please stop and take a seat I will prove to everyone here that the operation room ghost does exist What are you talking about Tell me Do you still not see him I see him clearly Let me introduce the Banseok University Medical Center ghost who did Ms Gils surgery Why are you here In this world proper doctors still outnumber those who arent Of course an attorney who only defends despicable ones wouldnt know YIHAN Yihan How did you find I came to have a talk with the junior I adore EPISODE This is Yes its a hospital Its not much yet but its cardiothoracic surgery Cardiothoracic surgery Even university hospitals have a hard time keeping one How can you do it here Thankfully I got all the medical equipment All I have to do now is find trustworthy staff someone like you Yosub You operated on Gil Soyeon didnt you How did you know that The victim remembers She remembers that Gu Hyunseong left during the surgery and another doctor came and performed ghost surgery The only one who can be a ghost surgeon for Gu Hyunseong is just you As you know Lee Dohyung and Cho Junghyun wont spill the truth We need your testimony to resolve the injustice Ms Gil faced And what if I cant be a doctor anymore I spent years I studied hard since middle school to get into a med school Then I did my internship residency and fellowship I held out for years without taking a moment off So if this mistake stops my career I know how you feel Just like you I was Gu Hyunseongs ghost It must feel unfair and frightening to have your license suspended and get kicked out of Banseok It might feel like a death sentence I felt the same way However this may be one mistake for us but to our patients that mistake lingers forever We operate on numerous patients but to them we are their only surgeon You told me that you hope I continue to be a cardiothoracic surgeon even if it isnt at Banseok I hope the same for you Even if it isnt at Banseok I hope you continue to remain as a doctor WITNESS Let me testify Im the ghost doctor who performed surgery on Ms Gil instead of the Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery Gu Hyunseong Are you admitting to your violation of the Medical Service Act Youre right I violated the Medical Service Act But I was threatened in the process Your Honor Stay quiet Threatened Who threatened you A man whos sitting here in the audience Assistant Director Lee Dohyung By the assistant director He was threatened What is going on Sorry What are you looking at Get to it But I cant operate on her without telling her guardians Then will they be happy if she leaves with her body part cut open It was either you or Director Gu Hyunseong anyway Were already short of staff so we have to make do with everything Just get started I couldnt turn it down I knew it was wrong but the surgery wasnt hard I thought I just had to perform it well But But the location of the tumor was unexpected This is too dangerous The tumor is in an odd location so if we cut it here we might hurt her nerves Director Gu Hyunseong left her with us So you wont do a thing Will you take responsibility Assistant Director is the patient awake That was shocking Her tape came off What do we do What if she heard us talk Shell think it mustve been a dream But still All right We have no choice now Youll have to do this successfully Then everything will be fine Im sorry I went into the OR before checking her CT scan I saw the danger once I checked the location of her tumor Yet I did not stop Im sorry Im so sorry Witness did you write yourself down as the surgeon in charge on the surgery record No I couldnt Why couldnt you The head of the Banseok Legal Team Attorney Pyo Eunsil over there gave me an order to stay silent on the change of surgeons This is slander The witness is slandering me with his onesided account According to Article Clause of the Medical Service Act when medical records are different from facts those who are affiliated must be imprisoned for up to three years Thats all for my questions Defense counsel do you wish to question him No The accounts of the witnesses completely disagree This means at least one side gave a false witness This may be a civil case but perjury is punished in the same way as a criminal case The witness accounts all align for the staff of the OR other than Choi Yosubs account So isnt it obvious to see which side committed perjury And the account of Choi Yosub the sole different one aligns perfectly with the victims statement In that case we have all the reasons to suspect which side is trying to cover up the truth DEFENDANT We must come to an agreement Well take a break for minutes DEFENDANT Man what will they do Both of you have done very well Do you think we can win Its a chance Banseok is also prepared well and above all the witness accounts completely disagree Im sorry No matter what happens I will gladly be punished If you tell me to quit being a doctor I will do that I mean it I am very sorry Why are you the only one whos apologizing The ones who did worse are making up lies and acting shamelessly Only you took my side today Why are you this sorry Why do you apologize Why are you bowing your head Im sorry Im Im so sorry Im sorry Im sorry Im so sorry Im sorry Man that idiot I told him to keep quiet but he just took himself down Why are cardiac surgeons always like this Our hospital is a mess You dont think well lose Do you Dont worry Its not like they have hard evidence The court wont accept ghost surgery What about awareness during anesthesia Are you saying theyll accept that I put her to sleep and witnessed that there wasnt a problem What now Do I get punished You just said it yourself In Korea awareness under anesthesia has never been considered medical malpractice No need to worry and keep your faces straight Lets walk in like winners not losers SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT I will announce the sentence In reflection on the account of Choi Yosub the witness its evident that the plaintiff remembers the conversation only those who were in the operating room could know Therefore the medical malpractice committed against the plaintiff such as awareness during anesthesia should be acknowledged However there isnt enough evidence to discern if the medical records were fabricated and if the surgeon was switched just as the plaintiff presented However the plaintiff suffered from medical malpractice during the mediastinal tumor resection and awareness during anesthesia The defendant must pay for restoring thyroid cartilage recovery and compensation for her mental distress Sentence The defendant must pay the plaintiff a total amount of million won Isnt this enough for us to say I won by decision Lady dont you know what winning by decision means You were destroyed by us Stop making excuses You can feel that way since our malpractice was acknowledged But thats not the case for him You probably worked hard to get your hands on the witness All such trouble for nothing Im not sure I dont think the match is over You dont think so What brings you here Prosecutor Geum I came to watch As you know I am greatly interested in Banseok And since I came around to watch I was thinking of indicting this case My dear junior you must be oblivious due to your lack of experience Even if hes found guilty of switching the surgeon he only gets fined up to three million won Its not even a fine Just a penalty Your hard work wont even put a scratch on Banseok I didnt say Ill indict him over switching the surgeon Hell be indicted for attempted murder What Attempted murder He opened up his patients body with a scalpel and left the OR Doesnt that mean he left her to die Then its attempted murder You psycho Do you think thatll work Why are you so worked up You can admit it and receive a favor just like Park Kitaes case Right I bet you cant do that this time Because this is Director Gu Hyunseong of Banseok Dont be so cheeky You barged in to arrest an innocent man with a false report only to get humiliated Dont be embarrassed again Dont worry Ill also indict him for violating the Medical Service Act and professional negligence resulting in injury Those are enough for imprisonment and revocation of his license Yes the trial is over Mr Han works like one of us He quietly turned a witness for their side and turned the tables at once I knew I chose the right man Also Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong was here Theyre leaving together Should I follow them No just come back They havent spent time alone in a long time You shouldnt interrupt them Youve watched Banseok R and D Centers activities and achievements up to now Now Ms Lim Yuna the new director of Banseok R and D Center who will be in charge going forward will give a speech Please give a round of applause Thank you for welcoming me Im the new director of Banseok

era Now anyone can extend their lives maintain their health and improve their quality of life by using medical devices But Ill not be satisfied with that Going forward as the center director Ill recruit outstanding talents and make the R and D Center an incubator to lead future medical technology through proactive exchanges with both domestic and global institutions Its quite good Can you go say hello Sure Hello I couldnt make a proper introduction earlier She is a CEO of a biopharmaceutical company Congratulations I was worried hearing that the new center director is so young What a passionate inauguration speech At BioValley in Boston startups founded by young CEOs are already recognized as unicorn companies worth trillions of wons If we dont want to fall behind them well need more young talent Yes of course Im very much looking forward to your accomplishments going forward Ill be rooting for you Thank you Thank you Sure Lets go that way Now the only thing thats really left is for us to become one family Well there is no reason to rush right It hasnt even been a month yet since she got back to Korea She is our precious daughter Hope you understand Yes of course I completely understand Hes my precious one and only son as well Hello Hello how are you Pardon me Chairman Gu Oh did everything finalize well Yes No actually I need to speak to you separately regarding that Attempted murder What do you mean attempted murder How did such nonsense come about Im sorry sir Ive never imagined Prosecutor Geum would side with a guy who killed her brother Thats why you shouldnt have let it go all the way to trial How could you allow one of our doctors to take the witness stand You said it wouldnt matter if the victim testified since she was delusional But nothing got taken care of properly Im sorry sir Ill correct the situation at all costs Ms Pyo Get out I cant stand the sight of you Get out Han Yihan Youre causing me trouble in the end This way NEWHOPE LAW OFFICE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF A LAWYER AN INTERVIEW WITH DIRECTOR GU JINGI OF BANSEOK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER INAUGURATION OF GU HYUNSEONG AND LEE DOHYUNG AT BANSEOKWON AGE MEDIASTINAL TUMOR RESECTION AWARENESS UNDER ANESTHESIA Youve been doing all of this alone I have people who are helping me SEOKJU VIPS HEART CHEON HYUNGU BAEK KANGHO PROSECUTORINCHARGE OF SEOKJUS CASE Kangho When I was held in custody for Seokjus trial Gu Jingi hired a convict to assault me and threatened to kill my mother unless I admit to breaching the Medical Service Act What If I hadnt admitted that way in court I doubt I wouldve come out of there alive Baek Kangho the prosecutor who charged me is working with Gu Jingi Its million won in cash We found it in your room Your medical license will be revoked for pocketing the bribe If you feel even the slightest remorse for Seokjus death admit the medical malpractice charge and ask for forgiveness Youre not even asking why my face is all beaten up Why are you doing this Youre not even listening to me Why are trying to blame me for Seokjus death Look Mr Han Yihan Do I look like a lawyer to you Im here to reveal your crime Other than the fact that youre a criminal it has nothing to do with me if you get hurt broken or killed Got that No way Kangho would never do that I know so If someone who would never do such a thing actually did so there must be another reason But why I dont understand it no matter how hard I think about it Why would Gu Jingi go out of his way to put a blame on you and kill Seokju to take away his heart Answer me You promised to be honest and tell me everything Why Why in the world did he do that Explain so that I can understand and believe it I said in court there is a ghost doctor at Banseok University Medical Center right Five years ago that was me What For many years I performed surgeries on numerous patients as a substitute In order for Gu Hyunseong to become the next director of the hospital he needed performance records of operating on VIP patients And as a part of the compensation I got to operate on Seokju at Banseokwon The night that I performed the heart transplant on Seokju a VIP with a concealed identity was rushed over to Banseokwon The patients heart was already removed so a transplant was needed immediately and Gu Jingi brought a heart Then that heart was Youre right I was deceived by Gu Jingi and transplanted Seokjus heart on the VIP patient How could he How could he do that as a human being Youre lying right How could a doctor I mean a human being A human being shouldnt do such a thing It just doesnt make sense I am sorry Had I known Had I stopped the surgery Seokju and my mom would still be by our sides I am sorry I am sorry Why are you looking at me like that You are wearing the earrings I promised to wear them for the inauguration And the other side The other one What do you mean The other earring Are you wearing it Of course Who wears one earring Then show me the other one Cant you do it Why are you being scary I am sorry I am so sorry I behaved strangely right Yes Very strangely But I will forgive you since today is a good day You should cool off I will change my hairstyle so that both earrings show Okay Thank you That punk How dare he toy with me Thank you Thank you Why didnt you tell me When you got out of the detention center five years ago you should have told me the truth You wouldnt have believed me then Besides I couldnt give an excuse Its true that Seokju died because of my wrong decision I dont ask for forgiveness I will also pay my dues once everything is done Welcome I am sorry that I wasnt at the inauguration I didnt want to make the situation messier How did Gu Hyunseong react You were right He asked to see the other one so I let him do that A prosecutor was here A prosecutor What do you mean Gu Hyunseong was here with a prosecutor I think he figured out that we were together How Dont worry If you do as I say nothing will happen Actually he will come to trust you more How did you prepare it Neither one of us knew that Hyunseong would show up How did you prepare the earrings I didnt prepare them Things simply worked out My goodness I thought hard about which presents would be meaningful to you the woman who has all I never imagined such a thing I bought the same earrings as the ones Gu Hyunseong gave you I didnt want to see you wearing a present from him when you were with me You always exceed my expectations and amaze me Dont take action no matter how he provokes you I understand Only the two of you can go in Okay Wait at the door Yes sir What are you doing Hold on We will be done soon Michael started the Queens Gambit Its daring and sharp Its the gambit that is best suited for the king However When the gamble fails you must pay the price How should we pay the price Restore Han Yihans medical license If you decline Honours Hand will sue The terms of the stock return we agreed upon will be called off as well Its a simple matter but I am curious about the reason Why do you ask for such a thing The reason Use your imagination until we meet again We cant do as he says Yihan shouldnt hold the scalpel again No need to make a fuss What he asked for was unexpected but its a cheap price to pay But Dont worry Han Yihan will never become a doctor again Why did you do that You could have asked for something bigger after a performance like this The piece that determines the game is the king But why is the queen stronger Because the king needs someone to fight for him Let me get this straight That lawyer guy will be your queen No Yuna is the queen My lovely partner who will support me by my side Han Yihan is my knight And a curveball you dont know where it will go Doesnt this look fun The man Chairman Gu Jingi feels the most threatened by will be my black knight Prosecutor Geum Nam Hyukchul is waiting in the interrogation room Oh right Yes Lets go Lawyer Han Yihan If you want to talk to me bring him to me Why do you want a lawyer all of a sudden You said you killed him because you didnt want to go down alone I thought I did But I changed my mind The murder case six years ago Ill file an appeal File an appeal But why do you want Han Yihan I may be locked up but I still have ears He won the trial against Banseok I can only trust competent lawyers like him What This isnt bad news to you either Once my appeal goes through you will get to hear all the dirty laundry Banseok is hiding I dont think I can do that Youre a deathrow convict who killed two doctors from Banseok Why would I bring in a lawyer who used to be a doctor at Banseok What if he becomes the third victim Who will take responsibility I wont kill him I want to put an end to this sickening prison life I have You can talk all you want but youre not getting him So tell me if theres any truth youve been holding back Or you can get a public defender What are you doing Youre crazy Get me Han Yihan Hey get your hands off her Or Ill kill you too Ill kill you and myself next Okay Go ahead if you can Get your hands off her Darn it Prosecutor Geum Are you okay Im fine Call an ambulance first And keep an eye on him so he doesnt try anything stupid thing Yes maam Darn it I Are you okay You should go to the hospital Im good This is nothing That crazy punk He wants to appeal now So he wanted Han Yihan Yes He said he wouldnt talk without Han Yihan We have no choice Give him what he wants Han Yihan will decide if he wants the case or not He needs a lawyer anyway What Is it uncomfortable to talk to him No Ill talk to him Jayden Lee He was the first Korean American to become the head of the Asian branch at Honours Hand five years ago When Banseok Foundation acquired a hospital in California and set up the R and D Center Honours Hand invested billion won Three hundred billion How do they have that much money The company manages enough funds that could run an entire country He invests aggressively His mergers and acquisitions are hostile He does whatever it takes to lobby his cause Hes known as a notorious lobbyist in the industry Its the biggest private equity firm in the world No way Yihan we should ask a lot for our fee How about million won No A billion won No I wont ask for money What Why not He promised to restore my medical license and provide us with medical equipment He will give us what I need the most Restore your license But how is that possible Gu Jingi of all people is stopping it Well see We also need to check how competent they are If he cant get that from Gu Jingi we dont need to work with him Gosh Lim Yuna Shes the only child of Im Taemoon the former ambassador to the US who will run for president next Shes gorgeous Her mother is Kim Sunhee

He said it had to be you He bit up his hand and created a scene by harming himself Well Im suspicious of his intention But I thought I should tell you at least Could this be a trap Even if its a trap I cant avoid it Dont worry I wont jump in recklessly Even a murderer must cherish his family BANSEOK UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE RESERVE OFFICERS TRAINING CORPS Is this a photoshoot Pardon Why are you trying to look pretty Its not a photoshoot Since its a dummy not a real patient you think you can just pretend to do it Ill deduct a point Wait And what kind of nurse would stop compression while performing CPR Ill deduct three points Wait Professor I can keep going Whats the point The patient already has a cardiac arrest To recover your points you should have used a defibrillator instead of continuing with CPR Professor I have a question Okay When the patient has a cardiac arrest if you compress harder wouldnt the heart start beating again You must watch a lot of TV shows What Should we punch the heart with our fist next Like this Like some cool doctor Its not impossible Shocking the heart is also a part of Advanced Life Support Then have you done it yourself too Several times In the field its very common to break the patients ribs during CPR Sometimes you can feel their hearts with your fingertips But despite that if you fail to save the patient you will feel hopeless And youll never get used to it no matter how many times you feel it This process may traumatize some of you here But remember that were medical professionals If theres even a onepercent chance that their hearts can beat again we never give up on our patients Who is it Were in the middle of our lecture Turn off your cell phone You Let me ask you a question too Have you ever done a surgery where you implant a

wowed with whimsical creations for International Week Grazie mille And Megans Northern Lights cookie scene This is a great Showstopper earned her the Star Bakers crown And Sadiya Its restrained I was scared had to say goodbye I would have loved to stay on longer but all is well that ends well Now its pastry week and the remaining six bakers technical skills are put to the test It is a bit tricky Please cook Theyre falling apart But who is next in line for the Star Bakers crown This looks pretty darn good Mmm This is a good way to start the day And who will flake out No Your dough is raw Oh dear Opa Watch any video online with OpenSUBTITLES Free Browser extension osdblinkext It feels good coming off of Star Baker but I feel like the pressures on to maintain a little bit of a status Just to do what I know and kick ass Were down to uh six now and it just keeps getting harder and harder here Im so excited to be here because I got off to this competition in a really rough start so to still be here past the halfway point you know its all I can ask for I have practised so much this week that I injured my elbow which Im calling bakers elbow Good morning bakers and welcome to Pastry Week For this weeks Signature Bake you will be making a slab pie Its a pie that is rectangular as opposed to round and the filling is a fruit of your choice What does that mean for me though More slices per pie Got it Alright bakers you have hours and minutes on the clock On your marks Get set Bake This is just like another day in the kitchen I wanna say but its never like that Im good Well see this Ugh time is of the essence Have you ever made a slab pie before No And so it begins again Its Pastry Week Pastry demands precision control and patience Pastry is so unforgiving Are you a pastry chef Yeah I mean sure Well see after today goes The perfect slab pie with the right ratio of fruit a nice crust you want that contrast of a mushy sweet filling and a nice bit into the dough Im working on the dough right now Oh geez Each baker will bring their own pie crust recipe for this challenge but at the centre of all of them is that one important ingredient I think the perfect pie crust to me is I mean I was raised on my grammys its butter Lots of butter Why butter Because I find that butter will give a crispier crust than shortening or lard I just want chunks of butter just because its better to have more than less Devon is making a plum butter peach and apricot pie decorated to honour a favourite activity with his friends Were a little bit of a uh how do I word this A geeky bunch so we get together we play Dungeons Dragons and I might serve something like this Are you rolling the dice on this one Gee thats a big chunk of butter So this dough now that Ive made it Im just gonna give it one final mix and put it in the freezer just to firm up a bit You see its quite soft and uh thats not gonna be very good when I go to make a pie out of it Sachins pie will be adorned with an elegant peacock and filled with thinly sliced green apples and frangipane Now by using frangipane are you concerned that you wont have enough fruit Uh you know Im using quite a thin layer in there Okay Im not gonna keep it too thick and Im placing a nice layer of apples on top of it So right now Im just rolling out my dough Im kinda like Oh my God oh my God cause Im not a rolling guy Im not the best roller but Ive been working on it Timothys slab pie will showcase a tiny dancer on a curtained stage above a filling of blueberries and banana I dont think Ive ever tried a banana in a pie before No cause usually you only find it in like a banana cream pie What are you gonna do with the banana I just throw it in and you know it No I What does that mean It sounds flippant but I dont mean it like that Getting this big pie to bake in time will be my biggest challenge Its just so goshdarn big The size of the slab pies means theres a real risk of the dreaded soggy bottom Lets get this in there To prevent this most bakers will blind bake their crust before they fill it with fruit But not everyone is using this technique Im not blind baking it No Im just sticking true to how I was raised We dont blind bake pies Real family family tradition Yeah Im trying to represent where I come from Who you are Yeah Megans pie is an ode to her farm depicting the flora and fauna she can see through her window and filled with Saskatoon berries handpicked just outside her door I would like to say I helped picking these Saskatoon berries but I refuse My philosophy is if my husband and kids want me to bake they need to pick The bakers must consider how much juice their fruit will release while it cooks Adding extra liquid should be done with caution So what kind of filling are you using today Im doing something that was very popular among chefs about years ago where they mixed strawberries with balsamic vinegar and pepper Yes Only strawberries Just strawberries Yea so now thats a very juicy fruit Yes Oh yes Andreis Strawberry balsamic slab pie will be decorated in the bold modern fashion of one of his favourite artistic styles Im just doing a sort of like art nouveau inspired strawberry pattern just to show that let me go total strawberry These are Nimbuss best friends Nimbus is my puppy and um she has two best friends Menglings wild blueberry and elderflower pie will depict Nimbus and her doggy BFFs howling at the moon Where did they meet No um Did they go to summer camp together Close Uhhuh anyway Dogs and friends and friends and dogs Okay So I just finished blind baking my crust Oh God okay Uh theres a lot of butter in here Way too much butter Thats not good Its just not baking the way it should have Back in the oven In goes the fruit And on goes the top crust decorations Its going in the oven Cook my pretty Please cook Okay Thirty minutes remain Its my dogs While everyone else waits for their pies to bake Devon is just starting to assemble Okay I am sweating What can I do to help I can make some dice for you Dice Yeah sure How many do you want Um just all of it Oh wow Im just using the tip just to cut out circles Thanks Andrei I really appreciate it When do I get to sample something Oh Guess what Youre a star Its just pie crust Mmm Okay do your best Twenty minutes bakers Twenty minutes remain Devon how much how much uh fat did you put into your pie In general like how much Theres a lot Way too much butter Whats happening Well were smoking Is that a good thing Um not usually Are you doing a smoky pie A smoked pie Yeah thats right Its gonna taste smoky Well its a dragon Its a big freaking pie Right Are you feeling confident When do I ever feel confident in this tent Julia Its true Not too shabby theres five minutes remaining on your slabbies Game time I think thats done Okay Im pulling it Its a little runny Wow that could be a weapon its so hot Okay Agh Oh Bakers you have one minute left Look at it go So liquidy Thats not good Time is up bakers Hands off your slabs please Okay The slab pies will now be judged by Bruno and Rochelle Do you know Timothy one ballerina under the spotlight with the drapes of the stage it just looks so spectacular Thank you Did you blind bake this For around twenty minutes Twenty minutes is just like warming it up If youre blind baking youre blind baking to bake it through You can see this layer of translucent Yeah Its not baked enough Okay Im just gonna go with the top Yeah Ive never done a pie with banana in it Um but the flavour works Thanks guys This looks and smells divine Mm Yep Good bake Thats a perfect slab pie for me Thank you The pastry at the bottom is beautifully crispy The fruit is sweet but not overly sweet And look at that shine Its beautiful Thank you very much Yes really good Well done Thank you Sachin I can see great concept However its a bit lost in the lack of contrast I wanted a bit more pop with my little peacock No totally I see that You got great flavour with the apple but you have so much dough on the top Yeah So you dont have the distinct apple taste The frangipanes made it really cakelike Okay and pie is fruit and pastry Okay I cannot see clearly the dragon Yeah I agree Oh boy Your dough is raw But you blind baked this I did but there was just too much butter in the dough Its a shame that its really underbaked Yeah Nimbus Cali and Maisy Maisy okay I just love the design However its lacking a bit of bake in this part And youve got a bit of bleed here Yeah Oh dear I mean the fruits holding Thats a good sign This is sensational Oh yes This is really elegant The wild blueberries are so punchy And youve got a good ratio of filling A lot of fruit which is good Yeah a lot of fruit Thank you I love that youve used the meringue Its a nice little extra Thanks It looks wet And your dough is not cooked at all Yeah Yeah I can see youre so upset I am Sorry Its gonna be great The flavours amazing Okay good The Amaretto with the lemon and the Saskatoon berries is just perfect The three of them are perfect together Should I have blind baked it But my grammy told me not to Maybe dont listen to Grammy Shes so cute though For once Only for once Shes so cute Its just frustrating Still tasted good Still looked pretty Its okay Im pretty disappointed I mean its entirely my fault I have no one to blame but myself Ive never made a slab pie before but now I have and if I have to go to like a person gathering I know what to bring now Its time to get technical And technically Bruno Rochelle youre not really supposed to be here but before you leave any words of advice Remember keep your cool Thank you so much Thank you Thank you very much Bye Okay so this next challenge is extremely delicate fussy and flaky Kind of like you Dan Gonna choose to take that as a compliment Julia Do You have been asked to bake sweet and savoury palmiers Oh no These French puff pastries are light layered and in a precarious palm shape Palm You have hours and minutes On your marks Get set Bake Oh my God Making palmiers Palmeers Palmees Palm trees Do you know what they are No So Bruno its Pastry Wseek Were asking our bakers to make us palmier Why Well every baker should know how to make a rough puff Which gives us a similar result to a more traditional puff pastry Flaky crispy and buttery So you can see all the layers of the dough You can see the perfect bake Mmhm Its crispy very light and has a good taste of butter Mmm We need to get them to make sweet which is very traditional but weve thrown them a curveball and were asking them to make us a savoury version Super delicious The most important thing about a palmier is the the shape Its a heart with a round bottom And so if our bakers dont know what a palmier is there in real trouble this week arent they Yes thats Pastry Week Do you know about the rough puff Done that before Ive made rough puff but not frequently so Okay Rough puff pastry is quicker to make than traditional flaky pastry which usually takes hours A food processor is used to incorporate the butter into the flour But it comes with a risk If the butter is overpulsed it will prevent the dough from puffing up in the oven I think I maybe missed half a cup of flour Maybe Are we familiar with palmier And you know growing up theyre one of our favourites Oh great Used to have this little place in Halifax called The French Pastry Shop It was like an oldschool pastry shop and my father used to take us Well its really good that you know what they should taste like I do Alright my love This is gonna be fun Good luck Yeah thank you Working up a sweat because cold dough is hard to roll Once the dough is ready the bakers need to do three rounds of rolling folding and chilling Okay But if they do more than three turns the pastry will be overworked and wont puff That was turn five and now Im gonna do turn six now This is number four I saw Andrei doing this I trust Andrei Hes my friend He knows what hes doing Thats my strategy for this technical Im blessed that hes in front of me I dont really know what to do with this bad boy The savoury palmiers will be filled with speck and Gruyere cheese I like that combination I dont even know what speck is Its ham right Yeah Its a kinda like cured ham Its tasty Yeah Okay Delicious The sweet ones are sprinkled with sugar Oh God I still dont know what these look like Have you seen them before No Im just gonna make them look like trees Some people call them elephant ears cause they look like the shape of an elephant ear To achieve the classic palmier shape the dough must be folded not rolled I have made the shape of a palmier which requires you to fold it three times then flop it over Uh cut to perfect thickness and place on prepared sheets and eggwash if needed for browning These are the sweet palmiers Just trying for consistency If we get there I dont know Oh geez Theyre falling apart Oh I think maybe Andrei has the right idea His palmiers are more like more thin Less Princess Leia Goin in the oven I hope they look okay Those look like palmier Do they Yeah I still dont really know what they are I dont think anyone really does or why they exist Palmyay Were almost done Minute and a half bakers No I have extras I have spares Oh Do they look cooked Theyre a puff pastry disaster Are they They just didnt puff as much as they should Do they look baked Theyre so pale Look at these little nuggets They should be nice and flaky and crisp Careful you dont burn yourself Ow Five seconds Palms in the air bakers Time is up Please bring your palmier up to the gingham altar and place them behind your photo The judges will be looking for the correct shape flaky pastry and a good bake First baker The classic palmier shape is like of a heart with no point at the bottom You need to fold your pastry in order to create that sort of elongated palmier shape as opposed to rolling the pastry inwards Lets try the sweet one first Yes Its beautifully baked Very flaky Beautiful buttery flavours Lets try the savoury one Nice snap You can see Nice crispy light And thats because of a nice lamination of the dough Excellent effort Second example Theyre quite thick Its undercooked The sweet ones Its not as flaky as I expect with a laminated dough This was pulsed a little too far Third baker This baker has actually folded the pastry which is really nice to see Its a bit tight Mmm You dont have much Puff You can see I have to fight it a little to break it Beautifully laminated but overworked The savoury one Its lacking some flavour I would have used more cheese Fourth baker The shape is not perfect but there is definitely a nice bake Lets try the sweet ones Uh the sweet ones Its too thick and its undercooked in the middle Fifth baker The texture of the dough just by looking at it is not right And it was clearly pulsed way too long in the food processor Lacks a lot of sugar therefore the flavour is onedimensional Its kind of flat Last but not least The outside layer is crispy and nice The inside is a bit dense Lets try the savoury one Very flaky and very nice and it has a good flavour Really tasty Bruno and Rochelle will share their assessment by ranking the palmiers from last to first In sixth place whose are these Devon Well yeah The dough was too dense Not enough sugar Wrong shape Yeah In fifth place Timothy These were Yeah quite doughy Yeah In fourth place Whose are these Megan The roll was inconsistent with a lot of holes in the sweet ones So in third place whose are these Andrei Great shape perfect shape but they were really just dry and tough from overworking the pastry In second place whose are these Sachin Good amount of sugar good flavour and crispy And in first place whose are these Mengling Youve had a cracker of a day Well done Thanks Yay me I got first in the Technical for the first time Im really happy I knew how to make palmiers so Im going to be annoyed about it but its not going to cause any problem in the future I dont think Looking forward I have a bit of a reputation as somebody who does well in Showstoppers so hopefully I can stay focused What would you say is the most important thing that these bakers should keep in mind going into this last challenge They need to forget everything that they did yesterday and focus on today and just give us their Agame and I think every single one of our bakers today realizes whats at stake No one is safe Good morning bakers Today the judges would like you to make breakfast pastries Specifically six danish six croissant and six sweet buns Now the croissant and danish can be made both sweet or savoury but the sweet buns should be well they should be sweet Thats right You have four and a half hours to make the breakfast basket of my dreams On your marks Get set Bake Have at er mixer Little knocked down yesterday Little knocked down Yeah yesterday wasnt a great day Today I just want to have fun Today we are asking our bakers to present us with a basket of breakfast pastries Time management is going to be the trickiest part of todays challenge I mean I just thought like What would I want for breakfast Like if I had a big day coming up like thats what I want Pastry is one of the most important skills you need to know as a baker The tricky part is your dough Is it fluffy Is it overproofed Underproofed A lot of things to worry about You know the worst that can happen is my dough is underlaminated and underproofed and underbaked you know Creating pastries with two different doughs and three different shapes and flavours is going to push the bakers to their limits I am doing my croissants and danish first because that one is the hardest dough to make I just decided to start with croissant because C comes before D in the alphabet or something I dont know Andreis Breakfast in Paris pastry basket will include a cocoastripe croissant an apricot danish and a swirly sweet bun Itll be like a pecancinnamon scroll No raisins No I didnt put raisins in it No Alright Its for the best Im not a raisin guy Yeah but this Not that this is about me but I Thank God I am stupidly obsessed with anything pear Im doing pear danish with a its called caged pear So theres actually a lattice cut top on top so it looks like the pears caged trying to break free Megans pear danishes will be partnered with hibiscus croissants while her husbands favourite coconutlime buns will round out her breakfast basket What is breakfast like in your home full of hungry hungry boys and man We dont do a lot of pastries for breakfast I usually have egg whites every morning Its very boring Well this is a bit more decadent than that Little bit I love the feel of this dough Its stretchysoft Smells awesome Croissant and danish dough must be laminated meaning that the butter is folded multiple times into the dough to create alternating layers So it hasnt really incorporated the butter very well I did cut it and you can see layers which is generally a good sign The number of folds or turns determines how flaky the pastry will be This is gonna be my third turn Ive done two folds two turns Im just gonna do two more Timing is gonna be really tight so Im only doing two turns Menglings twoturn dough will be shaped into yuzu croissants and strawberry cream cheese danishes Maplepecan sweet buns will complete her breakfast basket Im working on my sweet roll dough It is quite sticky but its okay its supposed to be Im not sure if its supposed to be this sticky though What did I come over here for Your danishes I dont know Eggs Goshdarn it This whole challenge seems very Christmassy to me because I dont have much time to make croissants on a regular day but during the holidays lots of time I am doing an almond croissant My favourite my moms favourite Along with almond croissants Sachins Christmas morning feast will include an orange spice sweet bun and a smoked cheddar danish I love laminated doughs I love croissants I worked at a bakery and would have two every morning Yeah And then regretted it deeply by the end of the summer Lets just put it that way Just a helpful hint bakers You have two hours remaining Finally the shaping of the pastries can begin Im using black cocoa to put a coloured stripe in my croissants I just have to laminate it to the croissant when I do the final shaping It is a bit tricky This is the morning bun filling Not too tight not too loose This is pretty darn good Im making a chocolate espresso covered croissant Theres chocolate covered espresso beans on top Its breakfast So I think you have to start with coffee right Devons breakfast pastries include chocolate espresso croissants and savoury Swiss chard danishes And hell make a hazelnut chocolate bun out of the leftover dough Growing up we would never waste scraps of dough so I wanted to pay homage to my mom and where I come from Thats really lovely Great Good luck Thanks Mines gonna be an almond croissant Im just creating the little danish cages for my mushroom filling I dont know if its too soft Orangecinnamon sweet bun Is that the stress release ball No no no This is cookie dough Im making melonpan or Hong Kong Pineapple bun so its Okay Oh Yeah I know those Its the bread thats covered by a cookie so you get kind of like a crunch on the outside and the sweetness of the cookie plus the softness of the bread inside And theyre gonna be decorated like bears Like what Like bears I hope its cute Timothys bearshaped sweet buns will be paired with almond croissants and caramelized onion and mushroom danishes Its a pretty good breakfast Its a hearty breakfast Its a good way to start the day While the shaped pastries are proofing the bakers work on fillings and toppings Cream chard for my danish I love cream chard Mushrooms thyme its awesome Ontario strawberries Im making a creme patissiere A lot of egg yolks and cornstarch and sugar and vanilla which I forgot to put in You have one hour left Time for the pastries to get ready for the oven Im working on the cream cheese filling for my danishes Strawberry jam and cheese Mmm Smoked cheddar Im making an apricot and pistachio danish My dainty man hands dont make this process very easy Okay alright Okay go Be free pretty things Turn it up Im shocking it with high heat so I can get all that butter and all the different layers to explode Its so nervewracking trying to figure out when to take them out Mmm Bakers this is your twominute warning Oh yeah Let em cool Megan Let em cool Oh Lord help me Oh dear Mmm Its breakfast You have one minute remaining Ugh So imbalanced Would you like to try some almond croissant If you like almond croissant Oh wow that was a bite Mmm Nice and crispy Mmm Thats ugly Thats awful Oh my God that feels nice Five seconds Alright bakers time is up Breakfast is served Opa The judges will now sample the breakfast pastries to decide who will get Star Baker and who will have to go home Sachin your pastries please The aromas coming off this are beautiful Thank you Were gonna start with the croissant I can see the lamination Great flavour Great And a lot of butter Thank you Next mushroom and cheddar danish Mushroom and smoked cheddar yeah You can see all the layers almost like a book The choice of smoked cheese is very clever Thank you Your orangecinnamon sweet bun Look at those layers It just opens Great Showstopper Thank you so much Im taking those home tonight I love the rustic presentation Oh my gosh Thank you So its cardamomyuzu croissants I can see that its laminated its just not laminated enough How many turns did you do in this croissant dough I just did two Minimum three And because it wasnt laminated enough your dough does not cook properly inside Did you do that because youve tried that before or you were running out of time or Um I thought that was one step that I could cut for timing Thats the thing with pastry You cannot cut corners Mmhm The maplepecan sweet buns Yes Good flavours Slightly overbaked as you can see These are your strawberry and cream cheese danish Taste is great Too bad you dont have that flakiness Mengling some technical problems Dont cut corners So these are your coconut and lime sweet buns Yes Clean flavours A lot of coconut so its very delightful Next is your pear and cinnamon danish Youve put this beautiful delicate lattice on the top They have created this lovely cage Great flavour Your pears are poached to perfection Beautiful The chocolate and hibiscus croissant Its very heavy and almost breadlike Oh I think its lacking moisture Oh okay So not enough liquid Your dough is To give that puff The flavours are really good Yeah and again overall great presentation Lovely Okay thank you Devon its a lovely brunch presentation Thank you So its your chard and gruyere Yeah danish So you got a beautiful bake all over The gruyere and the chard work really nicely together Theres not a lot of flake happening here I had some real challenges with my dough today Remember when you make pastries youve got to have it right from the beginning Yeah Ive learned that this week The croissant The croissants Does not have the flakiness What saves you here was your flavour So the sweet buns Chocolate hazelnut spread with pecans These were um made with the scrap dough from the croissant and the danish You can taste the chocolate and the nuts However its scrap dough of dough that wasnt perfect to begin with Great flavours Oh thank you Thank you so much If I was in Paris and if I call room service to get breakfast thats what I will get And you can see the swirls Um wow Youve nailed lamination Okay Okay good The texture is amazing I just wanna big pot of jam and just its a really good croissant Thank you So this is your apricot and pistachio danish Yes From the side you can see the layers that puffed up Beautifully laminated layers Now there is nothing better than eating a sour apricot and a cr\\u00c3me patissiere Oh I know The contrast just collide and explode Marry Its just beautiful Cinnamon sweet buns You could almost peel every layer one by one Let me ask you something did you ever consider moving to Paris opening your own little bakery No Maybe you should You pushed yourself and it showed So thank you so much Incredible skills Yeah Thank you Mm Go on a bear hunt Very cute Instagram worthy So this is the cookie dough on the outside and then on the inside is the sweet bun dough Yes Your dough reminds me of a German stollen Oh yeah Raisins Mmhm Orange zest These are your almost croissant Yes Thats a really great croissant Okay thank you So we have a mushroommozzarella onion danish They smell divine Great flavours Okay What youve produced is really impressive Thank you Good job So this was a really tough challenge that yielded some pretty amazing results So who really impressed you out of the bunch I think Andrei overall was a rock star Sachin also delivered technically brilliant pastry Timothy was very playful yet very professional And he was really ambitious Megan she knew she needed to up her game and she did Mengling had a really good day yesterday and today was a little rough on her Today she cut corners and it shows Devon had a lot of challenges this week and we obviously have to look at him At this stage were heading into the quarterfinals and we really need to make sure that the five that go through are our strongest bakers Well congratulations bakers on successfully surviving Pastry Week Weve tested your precision weve tested your patience and now we have the very sweet task of telling you who is this weeks Star Baker Now this baker has impressed us from the start but today produced pastry that could be found in any Parisian bakery Andrei congratulations for the second time youre Star Baker Thank you Thank you Now that of course means that I have the unsavoury task of sending someone home The baker that will we will be saying very sadly goodbye to today is Devon Im so sad to see you go Thank you This experience has taught me to you know take risks and to try new things and to not be so worried about the outcome Im this guy from a small town in Saskatchewan and its been incredible What an experience Well Devon always delivered great flavours but this week we were looking for exceptional pastry techniques But he brought a lot to the tent Amazing guy Andrei is just nextlevel Hes so incredibly thorough So were going into the quarterfinals This is the second time Andreis been awarded Star Baker Our other bakers better watch out Being Star Baker this week means a lot to me After Bruno and Rochelles comments about the quality of my baking is really overwhelming Im gonna

sounds flippant but I dont mean it like that Getting this big pie to bake in time will be my biggest challenge Its just so goshdarn big The size of the slab pies means theres a real risk of the

been asked to bake sweet and savoury palmiers Oh no These French puff pastries are light layered and in a precarious palm shape Palm You have hours and minutes On your marks Get set Bake Oh my God Making palmiers Palmeers Palmees Palm trees Do you know what they are No So Bruno its', 'lm trees Do you know what they are No So Bruno its Pastry Wseek Were asking our bakers to make us palmier Why Well every baker should know how to make a rough puff Which gives us a similar result to a more traditional puff pastry Flaky crispy and buttery So you can see all the layers of the dough You can see the perfect bake Mmhm Its crispy very light and has a good taste of butter Mmm We need to get them to make sweet which is very traditional but weve thrown them a curveball and were asking th', 'ut weve thrown them a curveball and were asking them to make us a savoury version Super delicious The most important thing about a palmier is the the shape Its a heart with a round bottom And so if our bakers dont know what a palmier is there in real trouble this week arent they Yes thats Pastry Week Do you know about the rough puff Done that before Ive made rough puff but not frequently so Okay Rough puff pastry is quicker to make than traditional flaky pastry which usually takes hours A food p', 'al flaky pastry which usually takes hours A food processor is used to incorporate the butter into the flour But it comes with a risk If the butter is overpulsed it will prevent the dough from puffing up in the oven I think I maybe missed half a cup of flour Maybe Are we familiar with palmier And you know growing up theyre one of our favourites Oh great Used to have this little place in Halifax called The French Pastry Shop It was like an oldschool pastry shop and my father used to take us Well i', 'l pastry shop and my father used to take us Well its really good that you know what they should taste like I do Alright my love This is gonna be fun Good luck Yeah thank you Working up a sweat because cold dough is hard to roll Once the dough is ready the bakers need to do three rounds of rolling folding and chilling Okay But if they do more than three turns the pastry will be overworked and wont puff That was turn five and now Im gonna do turn six now This is number four I saw Andrei doing this', 'ix now This is number four I saw Andrei doing this I trust Andrei Hes my friend He knows what hes doing Thats my strategy for this technical Im blessed that hes in front of me I dont really know what to do with this bad boy The savoury palmiers will be filled with speck and Gruyere cheese I like that combination I dont even know what speck is Its ham right Yeah Its a kinda like cured ham Its tasty Yeah Okay Delicious The sweet ones are sprinkled with sugar Oh God I still dont know what these loo', 'with sugar Oh God I still dont know what these look like Have you seen them before No Im just gonna make them look like trees Some people call them elephant ears cause they look like the shape of an elephant ear To achieve the classic palmier shape the dough must be folded not rolled I have made the shape of a palmier which requires you to fold it three times then flop it over Uh cut to perfect thickness and place on prepared sheets and eggwash if needed for browning These are the sweet palmiers', 'f needed for browning These are the sweet palmiers Just trying for consistency If we get there I dont know Oh geez Theyre falling apart Oh I think maybe Andrei has the right idea His palmiers are more like more thin Less Princess Leia Goin in the oven I hope they look okay Those look like palmier Do they Yeah I still dont really know what they are I dont think anyone really does or why they exist Palmyay Were almost done Minute and a half bakers No I have extras I have spares Oh Do they look coo', 'No I have extras I have spares Oh Do they look cooked Theyre a puff pastry disaster Are they They just didnt puff as much as they should Do they look baked Theyre so pale Look at these little nuggets They should be nice and flaky and crisp Careful you dont burn yourself Ow Five seconds Palms in the air bakers Time is up Please bring your palmier up to the gingham altar and place them behind your photo The judges will be looking for the correct shape flaky pastry and a good bake First baker The c', 'ape flaky pastry and a good bake First baker The classic palmier shape is like of a heart with no point at the bottom You need to fold your pastry in order to create that sort of elongated palmier shape as opposed to rolling the pastry inwards Lets try the sweet one first Yes Its beautifully baked Very flaky Beautiful buttery flavours Lets try the savoury one Nice snap You can see Nice crispy light And thats because of a nice lamination of the dough Excellent effort Second example Theyre quite t', 'ugh Excellent effort Second example Theyre quite thick Its undercooked The sweet ones Its not as flaky as I expect with a laminated dough This was pulsed a little too far Third baker This baker has actually folded the pastry which is really nice to see Its a bit tight Mmm You dont have much Puff You can see I have to fight it a little to break it Beautifully laminated but overworked The savoury one Its lacking some flavour I would have used more cheese Fourth baker The shape is not perfect but t', 'cheese Fourth baker The shape is not perfect but there is definitely a nice bake Lets try the sweet ones Uh the sweet ones Its too thick and its undercooked in the middle Fifth baker The texture of the dough just by looking at it is not right And it was clearly pulsed way too long in the food processor Lacks a lot of sugar therefore the flavour is onedimensional Its kind of flat Last but not least The outside layer is crispy and nice The inside is a bit dense Lets try the savoury one Very flaky ', 's a bit dense Lets try the savoury one Very flaky and very nice and it has a good flavour Really tasty Bruno and Rochelle will share their assessment by ranking the palmiers from last to first In sixth place whose are these Devon Well yeah The dough was too dense Not enough sugar Wrong shape Yeah In fifth place Timothy These were Yeah quite doughy Yeah In fourth place Whose are these Megan The roll was inconsistent with a lot of holes in the sweet ones So in third place whose are these Andrei Gr', 't ones So in third place whose are these Andrei Great shape perfect shape but they were really just dry and tough from overworking the pastry In second place whose are these Sachin Good amount of sugar good flavour and crispy And in first place whose are these Mengling Youve had a cracker of a day Well done Thanks Yay me I got first in the Technical for the first time Im really happy I knew how to make palmiers so Im going to be annoyed about it but its not going to cause any problem in the futu', 'but its not going to cause any problem in the future I dont think Looking forward I have a bit of a reputation as somebody who does well in Showstoppers so hopefully I can stay focused What would you say is the most important thing that these bakers should keep in mind going into this last challenge They need to forget everything that they did yesterday and focus on today and just give us their Agame and I think every single one of our bakers today realizes whats at stake No one is safe Good mor', 'ay realizes whats at stake No one is safe Good morning bakers Today the judges would like you to make breakfast pastries Specifically six danish six croissant and six sweet buns Now the croissant and

Underproofed ', 'dough Is it fluffy Is it overproofed Underproofed A lot of things to worry about You know the worst that can happen is my dough is underlaminated and underproofed and underbaked you know Creating pastries with two different doughs and three different shapes and flavours is going to push the bakers to their limits I am doing my croissants and danish first because that one is the hardest dough to make I just decided to start with croissant because C comes before D in the alphabet or something I do', 'C comes before D in the alphabet or something I dont know Andreis Breakfast

Smells awesome Croissant and danish dough must be laminated meaning that the butter is folded multiple times into the dough to create alternating layers So it hasnt really incorporated the butter very well I did cut it and you can see layers which is generally a good sign The number of folds or turns determines how flaky the pastry will be This is gonna be my third turn Ive done two folds two turns

kidding Ill say it once more You think you know about your brother but you know nothing If you continue speaking such nonsense Ill kill you Youre not making this easy are you I suppose thats natural though Suddenly being told such a story by a stranger like me But what I tell you is the truth Itachi did mention it did he not About his accomplice that night I am that Madara Uchiha I know everything about Itachi I suppose Itachi died without realizing that Shut up Such things dont matter anymore Just get out of my sight No you will listen You need to hear this Its your obligation For the sake of the ninja world For the sake of the Hidden Leaf Village And for your sake Your brother risked everything You will know how Itachi Uchiha lived Do you know why Why Itachi implanted Amaterasu into your eye Itachi was determined to make sure that you and I would not meet You will understand why as well as everything else when you hear me out Those who knew the truth about Itachi were Danzo of the Hidden Leaf the Third Hokage and his advisors Homura and Koharu Just those four The Third Hokage died and now there are only three aging folk Still those three will probably never reveal the abominable truth The truth about Itachi will fade into darkness forever And that is what Itachi wished However I know the truth about Itachi too As I said earlier Itachi died without realizing that However he wanted to make doubly sure It seems Itachi did not trust me So just in case I did know the truth he planned to silence me with the Amaterasu He probably anticipated I would show my Sharingan in order to speak to you What is this What is this guy saying Protect me Protect The truth Think back Think carefully and remember about Itachi Watch any video online with OpenSUBTITLES Free Browser extension osdblinkext About your kind brother Whats wrong This is it right The place where Father works This is the headquarters of the Hidden Leaf Police Force Ive always been curious Why is the Uchiha crest on the police force logo What You noticed that Who wouldnt Welllets see Simply put it seems our ancestors formed and organized this police force And so they used our family crest as the symbol of this organization From ages past our clan has been entrusted with the safety of the village The Uchiha crest reflects the pride of our clan While its numbers have dwindled even today nearly everyone in the clan serves on Squad One and is dedicated to preserving the peace and safety of the village After all only exceptional ninja are capable of preventing crimes that ninja commit Father is great after all Are you going to work here too I wonder about that You should No he He tried to kill me He tried to take my eyes Who would do such a thing Foolish little brother Mangekyo Sharingan Calm down Breathe slowly Dont touch me Even if you do hate me Thats what big brothers are for Sorry Sasuke Another time Fate Youre awake Sorry but I took the liberty of tying you up Since you werent gonna stay still and listen to me He Itachi was my enemy He killed our parents He killed everyone in the clan He was a Rogue Ninja A member of the Akatsuki He was despicable He was my target Its true that he annihilated the Uchiha clan that night And he deserted the Hidden Leaf Then And that is what he was ordered to do by the Hidden Leaf That is the beginning of the truth about Itachi It was his mission Yes That night Itachi killed his personal feelings and fulfilled his mission It seems youve calmed down a bit What are you talking about In order to talk about Itachi I must take you back to the early days when Hidden Leaf Village was founded Itachi sacrificed himself This is fate that has continued since ages past He was sacrificed for it Sacrifice Thats correct A huge problem rooted since the time Hidden Leaf Village was founded That is what determined Itachis life Its a long story but everything I tell you is the truth On what basis should I believe you Youre untrustworthy Theres nothing I can show you as proof And its up to you whether you believe me or not But you will hear me out until I finish Fine So talk It all started more than years ago The world was in turmoil It was the age of war Nations battled for power and to increase their territories During this age of war ninjas consisted of individual clans serving as armed units They were hired by various nations to participate in the fighting And among the many ninja clans two were feared as the strongest One was us the Uchiha clan And the other was known as the Forests Senju Clan We of the Uchiha clan possessed exceptional chakra and the Sharingan Excelling in all types of warfare we became known as a battle clan And I was born into the Uchiha clan possessing chakra that was especially powerful Perhaps the fact that Ive lived this long is proof of that Back in those days all I did was battle In an age defined by power I sought to become ever stronger and killed my friends and even my younger brother Why you As a result I came into possession of the perfect Mangekyo Sharingan and became the leader of the Uchiha And using that power I fought the Senju clan countless times It was inevitable that I face Hashirama the leader of the Senju clan Wood Style Hashirama Senju the future first Hokage The one who stood at the top of the ninja world And the one I respected most The Senju clan led by Hashirama who became the First Hokage was feared and respected by all the other clans If the Senju moved so did the Uchiha Our clan was probably the only clan able to compete with them If a nation hired the Senju the opposing nation would hire the Uchiha We were like rivals The more I went up against Hashirama the more my name became known as well To get close to the top to measure my abilities To heighten your reputation You took your younger brothers eyes just for that I did take them But I needed power in order to protect the Uchiha Protect Yes As the Uchiha name spread its enemies increased It was a necessary sacrifice to protect the clan during the fierce fighting with the Senju and the other clans It was not for my fame My younger brother was in total agreement and offered his eyes to me But one day the Senju clan offered a truce And the Uchiha accepted it Everyone in both clans had grown weary of the fighting that had dragged on for so long They had enough But I I was the only one who opposed it Where has all the hate gone For what purpose had my brother sacrificed himself The Uchiha and Senju are like oil and water I couldnt help fearing that in time the Uchiha clan would come to be oppressed by the Senju clan Howevereveryone in the Uchiha clan wanted a truce As their leader I had no choice but to go along with their wishes Shortly thereafter the ninja alliance signed a pact with the Land of Fire which had sought dominion over the territories The secure one nation one village system was formed and became the Land of Fire and the Village Hidden in the Leaves Other countries adopted the one nation one village system And subsequently the fires of war were extinguished Momentary peace But due to a certain incident the Hidden Leaf Village quickly descended into turmoil A certain incident A fightfor the First Hokages seat As you know the first to occupy that seat was Hashirama Senju The Land of Fire and the entire clan chose Hashirama It was inevitable that the Uchihas hold on the reins of power would loosen I decided that the Uchiha should take leadership That we should confront Hashirama But no one not even from the Uchiha clan supported me My subordinates who did not wish to light the fires of war were unsympathetic and betrayed me I was accused of acting out of greed and selfinterest Not only that They scorned me as a selfish brother who stole his younger brothers eyes in order to save his own What brother would willfully hurt his younger brother I justI just wanted to protect the Uchiha I left the village Everyone betrayed me I became an avenger and declared war on the Hidden Leaf Village And I lost At that place which became known as the Final Valley I was saidto have died there Even Hashirama believed it And everyone forgot about me History forgot about me Hashiramas younger brother who became the Second Hokage was determined that there would never be a traitor like me again So as proof of his trust he granted the Uchiha a special position And he created the Hidden Leaf Police Force But the truth is This was to further distance the Uchiha from the reins of government Furthermore it was a way to keep a close eye on the entire clan There were Uchiha members who realized this Members who wanted to carry on my rebellion Butit was too late Time passed The Senju clan solidified its hold on power and the Uchiha fell to becoming Senju dogs And what I predicted came to pass A certain other incident sealed Uchihas figurative demise Yes The attack of the NineTailed Fox Demon years ago What do you mean The NineTails can only be tamed and controlled by the ocular powers of the Uchiha The higherups of Hidden Leaf Village perceived the Uchiha to be behind this attack That was a natural occurrence a natural calamity The Uchiha had nothing to do with it Yet suspicion fell on them That the Uchiha had revolted and sought to take power As a result the Uchiha was put under the strict surveillance of the Anbu Black Ops and they were forced to relocate to the outskirts of the village They became totally estranged The Third Hokage was the only one to voice opposition to our treatment But Danzo of the Anbu Black Ops and the rest of the councilors would not listen In the end the Uchiha clan was not trusted And the discrimination began Their distrust bred hatred and eventually their suspicions became reality The Uchiha clan plotted a coup d\\u00c3tat to take over the village The higherups in Hidden Leaf Village planted a spy within the Uchiha clan That spy was your older brother Itachi Uchiha From that moment Itachis suffering began You laid false charges against the Uchiha Thats Itachis lie I wont believe it Itachi tried to kill me If he really wanted to you certainly would be dead However Stop it Ive had enough You should know why Because you are Next time on Naruto Shippuden Truth That is Itachis truth Tune in again Support us and become VIP member to remove all ads from wwwOpenSubtitlesorg\",\n          \"THE NAMES OF PEOPLE INCIDENTS AND BACKGROUNDS OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL The doctor changed I remember clearly I saw it and heard it myself The doctor The doctor changed during the surgery I think we need the head surgeon here I told you The VIP is here so he cant come This is too dangerous The tumor is in an odd location so if we cut it here we might hurt her nerves Director Gu Hyunseong left her with us So you wont do a thing Will you take responsibility Assistant Director is the patient awake That was shocking Her tape came off I was frightened I hoped it was just a nightmare Does Banseok University Medical Center know that she remembers the ghost surgery No They wont even hear us out We went a few times to complain but they wouldnt even let us in Thats why we came to see you What a relief Sorry We can win this case Soyeon from today until your trial you wont remember that the doctor changed during the surgery No I saw and heard everything Plaintiff The surgeon in charge wasnt there and a different surgeon did my surgery Plaintiff Calm down If you cause any more disturbance you will be removed Watch any video online with OpenSUBTITLES Free Browser extension osdblinkext Then it mustve been a ghost A ghost What kind of nonsense The victim saw it but no other surgeon did the surgery Then the only answer is that it was a ghost An operation room ghost that doctors at Banseok cant see This is false information Please stop speaking Sustained Counsel for the plaintiff Please stop and take a seat I will prove to everyone here that the operation room ghost does exist What are you talking about Tell me Do you still not see him I see him clearly Let me introduce the Banseok University Medical Center ghost who did Ms Gils surgery Why are you here In this world proper doctors still outnumber those who arent Of course an attorney who only defends despicable ones wouldnt know YIHAN Yihan How did you find I came to have a talk with the junior I adore EPISODE This is Yes its a hospital Its not much yet but its cardiothoracic surgery Cardiothoracic surgery Even university hospitals have a hard time keeping one How can you do it here Thankfully I got all the medical equipment All I have to do now is find trustworthy staff someone like you Yosub You operated on Gil Soyeon didnt you How did you know that The victim remembers She remembers that Gu Hyunseong left during the surgery and another doctor came and performed ghost surgery The only one who can be a ghost surgeon for Gu Hyunseong is just you As you know Lee Dohyung and Cho Junghyun wont spill the truth We need your testimony to resolve the injustice Ms Gil faced And what if I cant be a doctor anymore I spent years I studied hard since middle school to get into a med school Then I did my internship residency and fellowship I held out for years without taking a moment off So if this mistake stops my career I know how you feel Just like you I was Gu Hyunseongs ghost It must feel unfair and frightening to have your license suspended and get kicked out of Banseok It might feel like a death sentence I felt the same way However this may be one mistake for us but to our patients that mistake lingers forever We operate on numerous patients but to them we are their only surgeon You told me that you hope I continue to be a cardiothoracic surgeon even if it isnt at Banseok I hope the same for you Even if it isnt at Banseok I hope you continue to remain as a doctor WITNESS Let me testify Im the ghost doctor who performed surgery on Ms Gil instead of the Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery Gu Hyunseong Are you admitting to your violation of the Medical Service Act Youre right I violated the Medical Service Act But I was threatened in the process Your Honor Stay quiet Threatened Who threatened you A man whos sitting here in the audience Assistant Director Lee Dohyung By the assistant director He was threatened What is going on Sorry What are you looking at Get to it But I cant operate on her without telling her guardians Then will they be happy if she leaves with her body part cut open It was either you or Director Gu Hyunseong anyway Were already short of staff so we have to make do with everything Just get started I couldnt turn it down I knew it was wrong but the surgery wasnt hard I thought I just had to perform it well But But the location of the tumor was unexpected This is too dangerous The tumor is in an odd location so if we cut it here we might hurt her nerves Director Gu Hyunseong left her with us So you wont do a thing Will you take responsibility Assistant Director is the patient awake That was shocking Her tape came off What do we do What if she heard us talk Shell think it mustve been a dream But still All right We have no choice now Youll have to do this successfully Then everything will be fine Im sorry I went into the OR before checking her CT scan I saw the danger once I checked the location of her tumor Yet I did not stop Im sorry Im so sorry Witness did you write yourself down as the surgeon in charge on the surgery record No I couldnt Why couldnt you The head of the Banseok Legal Team Attorney Pyo Eunsil over there gave me an order to stay silent on the change of surgeons This is slander The witness is slandering me with his onesided account According to Article Clause of the Medical Service Act when medical records are different from facts those who are affiliated must be imprisoned for up to three years Thats all for my questions Defense counsel do you wish to question him No The accounts of the witnesses completely disagree This means at least one side gave a false witness This may be a civil case but perjury is punished in the same way as a criminal case The witness accounts all align for the staff of the OR other than Choi Yosubs account So isnt it obvious to see which side committed perjury And the account of Choi Yosub the sole different one aligns perfectly with the victims statement In that case we have all the reasons to suspect which side is trying to cover up the truth DEFENDANT We must come to an agreement Well take a break for minutes DEFENDANT Man what will they do Both of you have done very well Do you think we can win Its a chance Banseok is also prepared well and above all the witness accounts completely disagree Im sorry No matter what happens I will gladly be punished If you tell me to quit being a doctor I will do that I mean it I am very sorry Why are you the only one whos apologizing The ones who did worse are making up lies and acting shamelessly Only you took my side today Why are you this sorry Why do you apologize Why are you bowing your head Im sorry Im Im so sorry Im sorry Im sorry Im so sorry Im sorry Man that idiot I told him to keep quiet but he just took himself down Why are cardiac surgeons always like this Our hospital is a mess You dont think well lose Do you Dont worry Its not like they have hard evidence The court wont accept ghost surgery What about awareness during anesthesia Are you saying theyll accept that I put her to sleep and witnessed that there wasnt a problem What now Do I get punished You just said it yourself In Korea awareness under anesthesia has never been considered medical malpractice No need to worry and keep your faces straight Lets walk in like winners not losers SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT I will announce the sentence In reflection on the account of Choi Yosub the witness its evident that the plaintiff remembers the conversation only those who were in the operating room could know Therefore the medical malpractice committed against the plaintiff such as awareness during anesthesia should be acknowledged However there isnt enough evidence to discern if the medical records were fabricated and if the surgeon was switched just as the plaintiff presented However the plaintiff suffered from medical malpractice during the mediastinal tumor resection and awareness during anesthesia The defendant must pay for restoring thyroid cartilage recovery and compensation for her mental distress Sentence The defendant must pay the plaintiff a total amount of million won Isnt this enough for us to say I won by decision Lady dont you know what winning by decision means You were destroyed by us Stop making excuses You can feel that way since our malpractice was acknowledged But thats not the case for him You probably worked hard to get your hands on the witness All such trouble for nothing Im not sure I dont think the match is over You dont think so What brings you here Prosecutor Geum I came to watch As you know I am greatly interested in Banseok And since I came around to watch I was thinking of indicting this case My dear junior you must be oblivious due to your lack of experience Even if hes found guilty of switching the surgeon he only gets fined up to three million won Its not even a fine Just a penalty Your hard work wont even put a scratch on Banseok I didnt say Ill indict him over switching the surgeon Hell be indicted for attempted murder What Attempted murder He opened up his patients body with a scalpel and left the OR Doesnt that mean he left her to die Then its attempted murder You psycho Do you think thatll work Why are you so worked up You can admit it and receive a favor just like Park Kitaes case Right I bet you cant do that this time Because this is Director Gu Hyunseong of Banseok Dont be so cheeky You barged in to arrest an innocent man with a false report only to get humiliated Dont be embarrassed again Dont worry Ill also indict him for violating the Medical Service Act and professional negligence resulting in injury Those are enough for imprisonment and revocation of his license Yes the trial

that Attempted murder What do you mean attempted murder How did such nonsense come about Im sorry sir Ive never imagined Prosecutor Geum would side with a guy who killed her brother Thats why you shouldnt have let it go all the way to trial How could you allow one of our doctors to take the witness stand You said it wouldnt matter if the victim testified since she was delusional But nothing got taken care of properly Im sorry sir Ill correct the situation at all costs Ms Pyo Get out I cant stand the sight of you Get out Han Yihan Youre causing me trouble in the end This way NEWHOPE LAW OFFICE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF A LAWYER AN INTERVIEW WITH DIRECTOR GU JINGI OF BANSEOK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER INAUGURATION OF GU HYUNSEONG AND LEE DOHYUNG AT BANSEOKWON AGE MEDIASTINAL TUMOR RESECTION AWARENESS UNDER ANESTHESIA Youve been doing all of this alone I have people who are helping me SEOKJU VIPS HEART CHEON HYUNGU BAEK KANGHO PROSECUTORINCHARGE OF SEOKJUS CASE Kangho When I was held in custody for Seokjus trial Gu Jingi hired a convict to assault me and threatened to kill my mother unless I admit to breaching the Medical Service Act What If I hadnt admitted that way in court I doubt I wouldve come out of there alive Baek Kangho the prosecutor who charged me is working with Gu Jingi Its million won in cash We found it in your room Your medical license will be revoked for pocketing the bribe If you feel even the slightest remorse for Seokjus death admit the medical malpractice charge and ask for forgiveness Youre not even asking why my face is all beaten up Why are you doing this Youre not even listening to me Why are trying to blame me for Seokjus death Look Mr Han Yihan Do I look like a lawyer to you Im here to reveal your crime Other than the fact that youre a criminal it has nothing to do with me if you get hurt broken or killed Got that No way Kangho would never do that I know so If someone who would never do such a thing actually did so there must be another reason But why I dont understand it no matter how hard I think about it Why would Gu Jingi go out of his way to put a blame on you and kill Seokju to take away his heart Answer me You promised to be honest and tell me everything Why Why in the world did he do that Explain so that I can understand and believe it I said in court there is a ghost doctor at Banseok University Medical Center right Five years ago that was me What For many years I performed surgeries on numerous patients as a substitute In order for Gu Hyunseong to become the next director of the hospital he needed performance records of operating on VIP patients And as a part of the compensation I got to operate on Seokju at Banseokwon The night that I performed the heart transplant on Seokju a VIP with a concealed identity was rushed over to Banseokwon The patients heart was already removed so a transplant was needed immediately and Gu Jingi brought a heart Then that heart was Youre right I was deceived by Gu Jingi and transplanted Seokjus heart on the VIP patient How could he How could he do that as a human being Youre lying right How could a doctor I mean a human being A human being shouldnt do such a thing It just doesnt make sense I am sorry Had I known Had I stopped the surgery Seokju and my mom would still be by our sides I am sorry I am sorry Why are you looking at me like that You are wearing the earrings I promised to wear them for the inauguration And the other side The other one What do you mean The other earring Are you wearing it Of course Who wears one earring Then show me the other one Cant you do it Why are you being scary I am sorry I am so sorry I behaved strangely right Yes Very strangely But I will forgive you since today is a good day You should cool off I will change my hairstyle so that both earrings show Okay Thank you That punk How dare he toy with me Thank you Thank you Why didnt you tell me When you got out of the detention center five years ago you should have told me the truth You wouldnt have believed me then Besides I couldnt give an excuse Its true that Seokju died because of my wrong decision I dont ask for forgiveness I will also pay my dues once everything is done Welcome I am sorry that I wasnt at the inauguration I didnt want to make the situation messier How did Gu Hyunseong react You were right He asked to see the other one so I let him do that A prosecutor was here A prosecutor What do you mean Gu Hyunseong was here with a prosecutor I think he figured out that we were together How Dont worry If you do as I say nothing will happen Actually he will come to trust you more How did you prepare it Neither one of us knew that Hyunseong would show up How did you prepare the earrings I didnt prepare them Things simply worked out My goodness I thought hard about which presents would be meaningful to you the woman who has all I never imagined such a thing I bought the same earrings as the ones Gu Hyunseong gave you I didnt want to see you wearing a present from him when you were with me You always exceed my expectations and amaze me Dont take action no matter how he provokes you I understand Only the two of you can go in Okay Wait at the door Yes sir What are you doing Hold on We will be done soon Michael started the Queens Gambit Its daring and sharp Its the gambit that is best suited for the king However When the gamble fails you must pay the price How should we pay the price Restore Han Yihans medical license If you decline Honours Hand will sue The terms of the stock return we agreed upon will be called off as well Its a simple matter but I am curious about the reason Why do you ask for such a thing The reason Use your imagination until we meet again We cant do as he says Yihan shouldnt hold the scalpel again No need to make a fuss What he asked for was unexpected but its a cheap price to pay But Dont worry Han Yihan will never become a doctor again Why did you do that You could have asked for something bigger after a performance like this The piece that determines the game is the king But why is the queen stronger Because the king needs someone to fight for him Let me get this straight That lawyer guy will be your queen No Yuna is the queen My lovely partner who will support me by my side Han Yihan is my knight And a curveball you dont know where it will go Doesnt this look fun The man Chairman Gu Jingi feels the most threatened by will be my black knight Prosecutor Geum Nam Hyukchul is waiting in the interrogation room Oh right Yes Lets go Lawyer Han Yihan If you want to talk to me bring him to me Why do you want a lawyer all of a sudden You said you killed him because you didnt want to go down alone I thought I did But I changed my mind The murder case six years ago Ill file an appeal File an appeal But why do you want Han Yihan I may be locked up but I still have ears He won the trial against Banseok I can only trust competent lawyers like him What This isnt bad news to you either Once my appeal goes through you will get to hear all the dirty laundry Banseok is hiding I dont think I can do that Youre a deathrow convict who killed two doctors from Banseok Why would I bring in a lawyer who used to be a doctor at Banseok What if he becomes the third victim Who will take responsibility I wont kill him I want to put an end to this sickening prison life I have You can talk all you want but youre not getting him So tell me if theres any truth youve been holding back Or you can get a public defender What are you doing Youre crazy Get me Han Yihan Hey get your hands off her Or Ill kill you too Ill kill you and myself next Okay Go ahead if you can Get your hands off her Darn it Prosecutor Geum Are you okay Im fine Call an ambulance first And keep an eye on him so he doesnt try anything stupid thing Yes maam Darn it I Are you okay You should go to the hospital Im good This is nothing That crazy punk He wants to appeal now So he wanted Han Yihan Yes He said he wouldnt talk without Han Yihan We have no choice Give him what he wants Han Yihan will decide if he wants the case or not He needs a lawyer anyway What Is it uncomfortable to talk to him No Ill talk to him Jayden Lee He was the first Korean American to become the head of the Asian branch at Honours Hand five years ago When Banseok Foundation acquired a hospital in California and set up the R and D Center Honours Hand invested billion won Three hundred billion How do they have that much money The company manages enough funds that could run an entire country He invests aggressively His mergers and acquisitions are hostile He does whatever it takes to lobby his cause Hes known as a notorious lobbyist in the industry Its the biggest private equity firm in the world No way Yihan we should ask a lot for our fee How about million won No A billion won No I wont ask for money What Why not He promised to restore my medical license and provide us with medical equipment He will give us what I need the most Restore your license But how is that possible Gu Jingi of all people is stopping it Well see We also need to check how competent they are If he cant get that from Gu Jingi we dont need to work with him Gosh Lim Yuna Shes the only child of Im Taemoon the former ambassador to the US who will run for president next Shes gorgeous Her mother is Kim Sunhee Shes currently a diplomat She chairs the UN Human Rights Council and is an ambassador to Geneva Lim Yuna majored in medical engineering at Johns Hopkins University And last year she worked as the youngest senior researcher at a global biotech company at BioValley in Boston She was recently scouted as the director of Banseok R and D Center As the director Isnt she too young for that position She can if she plans to marry his son Shes dating Gu Hyunseong with marriage in the future I guess some people already know Rumor has it that they will announce their engagement soon But this lady is seeing Jayden too What is this The fianc\\u00c3e of Bankseoks heir is having a secret affair with Banseoks business partner Gosh This is a crazy soap opera in action What Hey We need to meet now I

doing Come in Its fine Okay Do you want coffee I have tea too Im fine with anything Ill have what youre having I took it out yesterday I had a lot on my mind after hearing about Seokju I found it when I was going through my stuff Nam Hyukchul asked to hire you as his lawyer He wants to appeal against the sentence of the murder case from six years ago Appeal Yes He said he wouldnt hire anyone else He said it had to be you He bit up his hand and created a scene by harming himself Well Im suspicious of his intention But I thought I should tell you at least Could this be a trap Even if its a trap I cant avoid it Dont worry I wont jump in recklessly Even a murderer must cherish his family BANSEOK UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE RESERVE OFFICERS TRAINING CORPS Is this a photoshoot Pardon Why are you trying to look pretty Its not a photoshoot Since its a dummy not a real patient you think you can just pretend to do it Ill deduct a point Wait And what kind of nurse would stop compression while performing CPR Ill deduct three points Wait Professor I can keep going Whats the point The patient already has a cardiac arrest To recover your points you should have used a defibrillator instead of continuing with CPR Professor I have a question Okay When the patient has a cardiac arrest if you compress harder wouldnt the heart start beating again You must watch a lot of TV shows What Should we punch the heart with our fist next Like this Like some cool doctor Its not impossible Shocking the heart is also a part of Advanced Life Support Then have you done it yourself too Several times In the field its very common to break the patients ribs during CPR Sometimes you can feel their hearts with your fingertips But despite that if you fail to save the patient you will feel hopeless And youll never get used to it no matter how many times you feel it This process may traumatize some of you here But remember that were medical professionals If theres even a onepercent chance that their hearts can beat again we never give up on our patients Who is it Were in the middle of our lecture Turn off your cell phone You Let me ask you a question too Have you ever done a surgery where you implant a heart that was implanted in someone else You must know better than anyone that its not possible We did it together five years ago with Seokjus heart Should we continue here Its fine by me APPOINTMENT CEREMONY IN NURSING DEPARTMENT BANSEOK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER Should I congratulate you You became a professor after becoming the head of the nursing department You achieved everything you could as a nurse as a reward for killing a patient You killed him Youre a criminal who lost your license for violating the Medical Service Act How dare you come here Dont come near me Stop I said stop Couples become more alike You act just like your husband What Im sure you know your exhusband Nam Hyukchul killed Park Kitae on Gu Jingis order I know nothing about this I already ended things with my husband I never knew anything about it and I still dont I dont know anything Nam Junhwan A yearold boy He had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy at the age of He was treated by an internist with medication at Banseok for years Gu Jingi gave him expensive new drugs that werent covered by the insurance for free So his symptoms improved without any transplant surgery And I looked into the new drugs Patients show great improvement in the beginning But once they develop tolerance when they relapse the symptoms get worse Your son who had to be readmitted to the VIP room makes a good example So what Are you here to gloat That I deserved it No You will have to face the consequence of killing Seokju Not your innocent son Then what do you want from me Im interviewing Nam Hyukchul tomorrow at the Central District Prosecutors Office Persuade him to tell the truth Then I will save your son SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS OFFICE Its been a while Mr Han If youre my lawyer shouldnt you sit next to me Im not your lawyer yet You havent signed any contract yet Youre hurting my feelings I was going to share some stories with you Do prosecutors attend the meetings with my lawyer This breaks the confidentiality clause I want you to leave us in private Im not falling for that Why would I leave you alone with him Did you forget this crazy stunt you pulled on me Suit yourself Im demanding my rights as the defendant With you here I wont tell you anything Its fine Leave us in private But He said its fine Okay Do you think Id kill him like this Be careful Ill be right outside Now talk What do you want to say to me about the case from six years ago Sorry I didnt want to do this to you What VIDEO RECORDING ROOM Nam Junhwan If you stab me now your son will die too How did you Nam Hyukchul Drop your weapon Answer me How did you know about my son How could I not Hes the only child between you and your wife Three years Thats how long it took for Seokju to find a donor Do you think your son could wait that long I can save Nam Junhwan Nam Hyukchul Three years He doesnt have that much time Nam Hyukchul Thats why I have to kill you Nam Hyukchul Do you think Nam Hyukchul will do what we want We should hope so The man I want to spend the rest of my life with isnt the Director of Planning and Coordination Are you asking me to become the chairman of the foundation Im asking you to surpass that position Surpass even your father I found something interesting Where did you find this I didnt expect much But I hit the jackpot Then does it mean this person took Seokjus heart You and the deputy chairman will meet again at last Im getting excited for you Its your turn to empty it out I knew it I can never predict his moves Translated by Dongjoo Park Please rate this subtitle at

Uh a UFO Its Intergalactic Week Its not Intergalactic Week Julia This is a baking show Im drawing pastries for pastry week Dont see it This is a pie Its a croissant Nope sorry Last time the bakers wowed with whimsical creations for International Week Grazie mille And Megans Northern Lights cookie scene This is a great Showstopper earned her the Star Bakers crown And Sadiya Its restrained I was scared had to say goodbye I would have loved to stay on longer but all is well that ends well Now its pastry week and the remaining six bakers technical skills are put to the test It is a bit tricky Please cook Theyre falling apart But who is next in line for the Star Bakers crown This looks pretty darn good Mmm This is a good way to start the day And who will flake out No Your dough is raw Oh dear Opa Watch any video online with OpenSUBTITLES Free Browser extension osdblinkext It feels good coming off of Star Baker but I feel like the pressures on to maintain a little bit of a status Just to do what I know and kick ass Were down to uh six now and it just keeps getting harder and harder here Im so excited to be here because I got off to this competition in a really rough start so to still be here past the halfway point you know its all I can ask for I have practised so much this week that I injured my elbow which Im calling bakers elbow Good morning bakers and welcome to Pastry Week For this weeks Signature Bake you will be making a slab pie Its a pie that is rectangular as opposed to round and the filling is a fruit of your choice What does that mean for me though More slices per pie Got it Alright bakers you have hours and minutes on the clock On your marks Get set Bake This is just like another day in the kitchen I wanna say but its never like that Im good Well see this Ugh time is of the essence Have you ever made a slab pie before No And so it begins again Its Pastry Week Pastry demands precision control and patience Pastry is so unforgiving Are you a pastry chef Yeah I mean sure Well see after today goes The perfect slab pie with the right ratio of fruit a nice crust you want that contrast of a mushy sweet filling and a nice bit into the dough Im working on the dough right now Oh geez Each baker will bring their own pie crust recipe for this challenge but at the centre of all of them is that one important ingredient I think the perfect pie crust to me is I mean I was raised on my grammys its butter Lots of butter Why butter Because I find that butter will give a crispier crust than shortening or lard I just want chunks of butter just because its better to have more than less Devon is making a plum butter peach and apricot pie decorated to honour a favourite activity with his friends Were a little bit of a uh how do I word this A geeky bunch so we get together we play Dungeons Dragons and I might serve something like this Are you rolling the dice on this one Gee thats a big chunk of butter So this dough now that Ive made it Im just gonna give it one final mix and put it in the freezer just to firm up a bit You see its quite soft and uh thats not gonna be very good when I go to make a pie out of it Sachins pie will be adorned with an elegant peacock and filled with thinly sliced green apples and frangipane Now by using frangipane are you concerned that you wont have enough fruit Uh you know Im using quite a thin layer in there Okay Im not gonna keep it too thick and Im placing a nice layer of apples on top of it So right now Im just rolling out my dough Im kinda like Oh my God oh my God cause Im not a rolling guy Im not the best roller but Ive been working on it Timothys slab pie will showcase a tiny dancer on a curtained stage above a filling of blueberries and banana I dont think Ive ever tried a banana in a pie before No cause usually you only find it in like a banana cream pie What are you gonna do with the banana I just throw it in and you know it No I What does that mean It sounds flippant but I dont mean it like that Getting this big pie to bake in time will be my biggest challenge Its just so goshdarn big The size of the slab pies means theres a real risk of the dreaded soggy bottom Lets get this in there To prevent this most bakers will blind bake their crust before they fill it with fruit But not everyone is using this technique Im not blind baking it No Im just sticking true to how I was raised We dont blind bake pies Real family family tradition Yeah Im trying to represent where I come from Who you are Yeah Megans pie is an ode to her farm depicting the flora and fauna she can see through her window and filled with Saskatoon berries handpicked just outside her door I would like to say I helped picking these Saskatoon berries but I refuse My philosophy is if my husband and kids want me to bake they need to pick The bakers must consider how much juice their fruit will release while it cooks Adding extra liquid should be done with caution So what kind of filling are you using today Im doing something that was very popular among chefs about years ago where they mixed strawberries with balsamic vinegar and pepper Yes Only strawberries Just strawberries Yea so now thats a very juicy fruit Yes Oh yes Andreis Strawberry balsamic slab pie will be decorated in the bold modern fashion of one of his favourite artistic styles Im just doing a sort of like art nouveau inspired strawberry pattern just to show that let me go total strawberry These are Nimbuss best friends Nimbus is my puppy and um she has two best friends Menglings wild blueberry and elderflower pie will depict Nimbus and her doggy BFFs howling at the moon Where did they meet No um Did they go to summer camp together Close Uhhuh anyway Dogs and friends and friends and dogs Okay So I just finished blind baking my crust Oh God okay Uh theres a lot of butter in here Way too much butter Thats not good Its just not baking the way it should have Back in the oven In goes the fruit And on goes the top crust decorations Its going in the oven Cook my pretty Please cook Okay Thirty minutes remain Its my dogs While everyone else waits for their pies to bake Devon is just starting to assemble Okay I am sweating What can I do to help I can make some dice for you Dice Yeah sure How many do you want Um just all of it Oh wow Im just using the tip just to cut out circles Thanks Andrei I really appreciate it When do I get to sample something Oh Guess what Youre a star Its just pie crust Mmm Okay do your best Twenty minutes bakers Twenty minutes remain Devon how much how much uh fat did you put into your pie In general like how much Theres a lot Way too much butter Whats happening Well were smoking Is that a good thing Um not usually Are you doing a smoky pie A smoked pie Yeah thats right Its gonna taste smoky Well its a dragon Its a big freaking pie Right Are you feeling confident When do I ever feel confident in this tent Julia Its true Not too shabby theres five minutes remaining on your slabbies Game time I think thats done Okay Im pulling it Its a little runny Wow that could be a weapon its so hot Okay Agh Oh Bakers you have one minute left Look at it go So liquidy Thats not good Time is up bakers Hands off your slabs please Okay The slab pies will now be judged by Bruno and Rochelle Do you know Timothy one ballerina under the spotlight with the drapes of the stage it just looks so spectacular Thank you Did you blind bake this For around twenty minutes Twenty minutes is just like warming it up If youre blind baking youre blind baking to bake it through You can see this layer of translucent Yeah Its not baked enough Okay Im just gonna go with the top Yeah Ive never done a pie with banana in it Um but the flavour works Thanks guys This looks and smells divine Mm Yep Good bake Thats a perfect slab pie for me Thank you The pastry at the bottom is beautifully crispy The fruit is sweet but not overly sweet And look at that shine Its beautiful Thank you very much Yes really good Well done Thank you Sachin I can see great concept However its a bit lost in the lack of contrast I wanted a bit more pop with my little peacock No totally I see that You got great flavour with the apple but you have so much dough on the top Yeah So you dont have the distinct apple taste The frangipanes made it really cakelike Okay and pie is fruit and pastry Okay I cannot see clearly the dragon Yeah I agree Oh boy Your dough is raw But you blind baked this I did but there was just too much butter in the dough Its a shame that its really underbaked Yeah Nimbus Cali and Maisy Maisy okay I just love the design However its lacking a bit of bake in this part And youve got a bit of bleed here Yeah Oh dear I mean the fruits holding Thats a good sign This is sensational Oh yes This is really elegant The wild blueberries are so punchy And youve got a good ratio of filling A lot of fruit which is good Yeah a lot of fruit Thank you I love that youve used the meringue Its a nice little extra Thanks It looks wet And your dough is not cooked at all Yeah Yeah I can see youre so upset I am Sorry Its gonna be great The flavours amazing Okay good The Amaretto with the lemon and the Saskatoon berries is just perfect The three of them are perfect together Should I have blind baked it But my grammy told me not to Maybe dont listen to Grammy Shes so cute though For once Only for once Shes so cute Its just frustrating Still tasted good Still looked pretty Its okay Im pretty disappointed I mean its entirely my fault I have no one to blame but myself Ive never made a slab pie before but now I have and if I have to go to like a person gathering I know what to bring now Its time to get technical And technically Bruno Rochelle youre not really supposed to be here but before you leave any words of advice Remember keep your cool Thank you so much Thank you Thank you very much Bye Okay so this next challenge is extremely delicate fussy and flaky Kind of like you Dan Gonna choose to take that as a compliment Julia Do You have been asked to bake sweet and savoury palmiers Oh no These French puff pastries are light layered and in a precarious palm shape Palm You have hours and minutes On your marks Get set Bake Oh my God Making palmiers Palmeers Palmees Palm trees Do you know what they are No So Bruno its Pastry Wseek Were asking our bakers to make us palmier Why Well every baker should know how to make a rough puff Which gives us a similar result to a more traditional puff pastry Flaky crispy and buttery So you can see all the layers of the dough You can see the perfect bake Mmhm Its crispy very light and has a good taste of butter Mmm We need to get them to make sweet which is very traditional but weve thrown them a curveball and were asking them to make us a savoury version Super delicious The most important thing about a palmier is the the shape Its a heart with a round bottom And so if our bakers dont know what a palmier is there in real trouble this week arent they Yes thats Pastry Week Do you know about the rough puff Done that before Ive made rough puff but not frequently so Okay Rough puff pastry is quicker to make than traditional flaky pastry which usually takes hours A food processor is used to incorporate the butter into the flour But it comes with a risk If the butter is overpulsed it will prevent the dough from puffing up in the oven I think I maybe missed half a cup of flour Maybe Are we familiar with palmier And you know growing up theyre one of our favourites Oh great Used to have this little place in Halifax called The French Pastry Shop It was like an oldschool pastry shop and my father used to take us Well its really good that you know what they should taste like I do Alright my love This is gonna be fun Good luck Yeah thank you Working up a sweat because cold dough is hard to roll Once the dough is ready the bakers need to do three rounds of rolling folding and chilling Okay But if they do more than three turns the pastry will be overworked and wont puff That was turn five and now Im gonna do turn six now This is number four I saw Andrei doing this I trust Andrei Hes my friend He knows what hes doing Thats my strategy for this technical Im blessed that hes in front of me I dont really know what to do with this bad boy The savoury palmiers will be filled with speck and Gruyere cheese I like that combination I dont even know what speck is Its ham right Yeah Its a kinda like cured ham Its tasty Yeah Okay Delicious The sweet ones are sprinkled with sugar Oh God I still dont know what these look like Have you seen them before No Im just gonna make them look like trees Some people call them elephant ears cause they look like the shape of an elephant ear To achieve the classic palmier shape the dough must be folded not rolled I have made the shape of a palmier which requires you to fold it three times then flop it over Uh cut to perfect thickness and place on prepared sheets and eggwash if needed for browning These are the sweet palmiers Just trying for consistency If we get there I dont know Oh geez Theyre falling apart Oh I think maybe Andrei has the right idea His palmiers are more like more thin Less Princess Leia Goin in the oven I hope they look okay Those look like palmier Do they Yeah I still dont really know what they are I dont think anyone really does or why they exist Palmyay Were almost done Minute and a half bakers No I have extras I have spares Oh Do they look cooked Theyre a puff pastry disaster Are they They just didnt puff as much as they should Do they look baked Theyre so pale Look at these little nuggets They should be nice and flaky and crisp Careful you dont burn yourself Ow Five seconds Palms in the air bakers Time is up Please bring your palmier up to the gingham altar and place them behind your photo The judges will be looking for the correct shape flaky pastry and a good bake First baker The classic palmier shape is like of a heart with no point at the bottom You need to fold your pastry in order to create that sort of elongated palmier shape as opposed to rolling the pastry inwards Lets try the sweet one first Yes Its beautifully baked Very flaky Beautiful buttery flavours Lets try the savoury one Nice snap You can see Nice crispy light And thats because of a nice lamination of the dough Excellent effort Second example Theyre quite thick Its undercooked The sweet ones Its not as flaky as I expect with a laminated dough This was pulsed a little too far Third baker This baker has actually folded the pastry which is really nice to see Its a bit tight Mmm You dont have much Puff You can see I have to fight it a little to break it Beautifully laminated but overworked The savoury one Its lacking some flavour I would have used more cheese Fourth baker The shape is not perfect but there is definitely a nice bake Lets try the sweet ones Uh the sweet ones Its too thick and its undercooked in the middle Fifth baker The texture of the dough just by looking at it is not right And it was clearly pulsed way too long in the food processor Lacks a lot of sugar therefore the flavour is onedimensional Its kind of flat Last but not least The outside layer is crispy and nice The inside is a bit dense Lets try the savoury one Very flaky and very nice and it has a good flavour Really tasty Bruno and Rochelle will share their assessment by ranking the palmiers from last to first In sixth place whose are these Devon Well yeah The dough was too dense Not enough sugar Wrong shape Yeah In fifth place Timothy These were Yeah quite doughy Yeah In fourth place Whose are these Megan The roll was inconsistent with a lot of holes in the sweet ones So in third place whose are these Andrei Great shape perfect shape but they were really just dry and tough from overworking the pastry In second place whose are these Sachin Good amount of sugar good flavour and crispy And in first place whose are these Mengling Youve had a cracker of a day Well done Thanks Yay me I got first in the Technical for the first time Im really happy I knew how to make palmiers so Im going to be annoyed about it but its not going to cause any problem in the future I dont think Looking forward I have a bit of a reputation as somebody who does well in Showstoppers so hopefully I can stay focused What would you say is the most important thing that these bakers should keep in mind going into this last challenge They need to forget everything that they did yesterday and focus on today and just give us their Agame and I think every single one of our bakers today realizes whats at stake No one is safe Good morning bakers Today the judges would like you to make breakfast pastries Specifically six danish six croissant and six sweet buns Now the croissant and danish can be made both sweet or savoury but the sweet buns should be well they should be sweet Thats right You have four and a half hours to make the breakfast basket of my dreams On your marks Get set Bake Have at er mixer Little knocked down yesterday Little knocked down Yeah yesterday wasnt a great day Today I just want to have fun Today we are asking our bakers to present us with a basket of breakfast pastries Time management is going to be the trickiest part of todays challenge I mean I just thought like What would I want for breakfast Like if I had a big day coming up like thats what I want Pastry is one of the most important skills you need to know as a baker The tricky part is your dough Is it fluffy Is it overproofed Underproofed A lot of things to worry about You know the worst that can happen is my dough is underlaminated and underproofed and underbaked you know Creating pastries with two different doughs and three different shapes and flavours is going to push the bakers to their limits I am doing my croissants and danish first because that one is the hardest dough to make I just decided to start with croissant because C comes before D in the alphabet or something I dont know Andreis Breakfast in Paris pastry basket will include a cocoastripe croissant an apricot danish and a swirly sweet bun Itll be like a pecancinnamon scroll No raisins No I didnt put raisins in it No Alright Its for the best Im not a raisin guy Yeah but this Not that this is about me but I Thank God I am stupidly obsessed with anything pear Im doing pear danish with a its called caged pear So theres actually a lattice cut top on top so it looks like the pears caged trying to break free Megans pear danishes will be partnered with hibiscus croissants while her husbands favourite coconutlime buns will round out her breakfast basket What is breakfast like in your home full of hungry hungry boys and man We dont do a lot of pastries for breakfast I usually have egg whites every morning Its very boring Well this is a bit more decadent than that Little bit I love the feel of this dough Its stretchysoft Smells awesome Croissant and danish dough must be laminated meaning that the butter is folded multiple times into the dough to create alternating layers So it hasnt really incorporated the butter very well I did cut it and you can see layers which is generally a good sign The number of folds or turns determines how flaky the pastry will be This is gonna be my third turn Ive done two folds two turns Im just gonna do two more Timing is gonna be really tight so Im only doing two turns Menglings twoturn dough will be shaped into yuzu croissants and strawberry cream cheese danishes

Making palmiers Palmeers Palmees Palm trees Do you know what they are No So Bruno its', 'lm trees Do you know what they are No So Bruno its Pastry Wseek Were asking our bakers to make us palmier Why Well every baker should know how to make a rough puff Which gives us a similar result to a more traditional puff pastry Flaky crispy and buttery So you can see all the layers of the dough You can see the perfect bake Mmhm Its crispy very light and has a good taste of butter Mmm We need to get them to make sweet which is very traditional but weve thrown them a curveball and were asking th', 'ut weve thrown them a curveball and were asking them to make us a savoury version Super delicious The most important thing about a palmier is the the shape Its a heart with a round bottom And so if our bakers dont know what a palmier is there in real trouble this week arent they Yes thats Pastry Week Do you know about the rough puff Done that before Ive made rough puff but not frequently so Okay Rough puff pastry is quicker to make than traditional flaky pastry which usually takes hours A food p', 'al flaky pastry which usually takes hours A food processor is used to incorporate the butter into the flour But it comes with a risk If the butter is overpulsed it will prevent the dough from puffing up in the oven I think I maybe missed half a cup of flour Maybe Are we familiar with palmier And you know growing up theyre one of our favourites Oh great Used to have this little place in Halifax called The French Pastry Shop It was like an oldschool pastry shop and my father used to take us Well i', 'l pastry shop and my father used to take us Well its really good that you know what they should taste like I do Alright my love This is gonna be fun Good luck Yeah thank you Working up a sweat because cold dough is hard to roll Once the dough is ready the bakers need to do three rounds of rolling folding and chilling Okay But if they do more than three turns the pastry will be overworked and wont puff That was turn five and now Im gonna do turn six now This is number four I saw Andrei doing this', 'ix now This is number four I saw Andrei doing this I trust Andrei Hes my friend He knows what hes doing Thats my strategy for this technical Im blessed that hes in front of me I dont really know what to do with this bad boy The savoury palmiers will be filled with speck and Gruyere cheese I like that combination I dont even know what speck is Its ham right Yeah Its a kinda like cured ham Its tasty Yeah Okay Delicious The sweet ones are sprinkled with sugar Oh God I still dont know what these loo', 'with sugar Oh God I still dont know what these look like Have you seen them before No Im just gonna make them look like trees Some people call them elephant ears cause they look like the shape of an elephant ear To achieve the classic palmier shape the dough must be folded not rolled I have made the shape of a palmier which requires you to fold it three times then flop it over Uh cut to perfect thickness and place on prepared sheets and eggwash if needed for browning These are the sweet palmiers', 'f needed for browning These are the sweet palmiers Just trying for consistency If we get there I dont know Oh geez Theyre falling apart Oh I think maybe Andrei has the right idea His palmiers are more like more thin Less Princess Leia Goin in the oven I hope they look okay Those look like palmier Do they Yeah I still dont really know what they are I dont think anyone really does or why they exist Palmyay Were almost done Minute and a half bakers No I have extras I have spares Oh Do they look coo', 'No I have extras I have spares Oh Do they look cooked Theyre a puff pastry disaster Are they They just didnt puff as much as they should Do they look baked Theyre so pale Look at these little nuggets They should be nice and flaky and crisp Careful you dont burn yourself Ow Five seconds Palms in the air bakers Time is up Please bring your palmier up to the gingham altar and place them behind your photo The judges will be looking for the correct shape flaky pastry and a good bake First baker The c', 'ape flaky pastry and a good bake First baker The classic palmier shape is like of a heart with no point at the bottom You need to fold your pastry in order to create that sort of elongated palmier shape as opposed to rolling the pastry inwards Lets try the sweet one first Yes Its beautifully baked Very flaky Beautiful buttery flavours Lets try the savoury one Nice snap You can see Nice crispy light And thats because of a nice lamination of the dough Excellent effort Second example Theyre quite t', 'ugh Excellent effort Second example Theyre quite thick Its undercooked The sweet ones Its not as flaky as I expect with a laminated dough This was pulsed a little too far Third baker This baker has actually folded the pastry which is really nice to see Its a bit tight Mmm You dont have much Puff You can see I have to fight it a little to break it Beautifully laminated but overworked The savoury one Its lacking some flavour I would have used more cheese Fourth baker The shape is not perfect but t', 'cheese Fourth baker The shape is not perfect but there is definitely a nice bake Lets try the sweet ones Uh the sweet ones Its too thick and its undercooked in the middle Fifth baker The texture of the dough just by looking at it is not right And it was clearly pulsed way too long in the food processor Lacks a lot of sugar therefore the flavour is onedimensional Its kind of flat Last but not least The outside layer is crispy and nice The inside is a bit dense Lets try the savoury one Very flaky ', 's a bit dense Lets try the savoury one Very flaky and very nice and it has a good flavour Really tasty Bruno and Rochelle will share their assessment by ranking the palmiers from last to first In sixth place whose are these Devon Well yeah The dough was too dense Not enough sugar Wrong shape Yeah In fifth place Timothy These were Yeah quite doughy Yeah In fourth place Whose are these Megan The roll was inconsistent with a lot of holes in the sweet ones So in third place whose are these Andrei Gr', 't ones So in third place whose are these Andrei Great shape perfect shape but they were really just dry and tough from overworking the pastry In second place whose are these Sachin Good amount of sugar good flavour and crispy And in first place whose are these Mengling Youve had a cracker of a day Well done Thanks Yay me I got first in the Technical for the first time Im really happy I knew how to make palmiers so Im going to be annoyed about it but its not going to cause any problem in the futu', 'but its not going to cause any problem in the future I dont think Looking forward I have a bit of a reputation as somebody who does well in Showstoppers so hopefully I can stay focused What would you say is the most important thing that these bakers should keep in mind going into this last challenge They need to forget everything that they did yesterday and focus on today and just give us their Agame and I think every single one of our bakers today realizes whats at stake No one is safe Good mor', 'ay realizes whats at stake No one is safe Good morning bakers Today the judges would like you to make breakfast pastries Specifically six danish six croissant and six sweet buns Now the croissant and

we are asking our bakers to present us with a basket of breakfast pastries Time management is going to be the trickiest part of todays challenge I mean I just thought like What would I want for breakfast Like if I had a big day coming up like thats what I want Pastry is one of the most important skills you need to know as a baker The tricky part is your dough Is it fluffy Is it overproofed Underproofed ', 'dough Is it fluffy Is it overproofed Underproofed A lot of things to worry about You know the worst that can happen is my dough is underlaminated and underproofed and underbaked you know Creating pastries with two different doughs and three different shapes and flavours is going to push the bakers to their limits I am doing my croissants and danish first because that one is the hardest dough to make I just decided to start with croissant because C comes before D in the alphabet or something I do', 'C comes before D in the alphabet or something I dont know Andreis Breakfast in Paris pastry basket will include a cocoastripe croissant an apricot danish and a swirly sweet bun Itll be like a pecancinnamon scroll No raisins No I didnt put raisins in it No Alright Its for the

her husbands favourite coconutlime buns will round out her breakfast basket What is breakfast like in your home full of hungry hungry boys and man We dont do a lot of pastries for breakfast I usually have egg whites every morning Its very boring Well this is a bit more decadent than that Little bit I love the feel of this dough Its', ' that Little bit I love the feel of this dough Its stretchysoft
